      <title>Configuring WezTerm on my Linux MacBook Air</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After setting up Linux on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://sadique.io/blog/2025/11/27/keeping-a-mid-2011-macbook-air-running-with-linux/&#34;&gt;MacBook Air&lt;/a&gt; as we discussed in the last blog post, the next item to sort out was making sure that the keyboard shortcuts that I have always used continue to work. Since the macOS key bindings I set up using &lt;code&gt;gnome-macos-remap-wayland&lt;/code&gt; had special configurations in place to handle &lt;code&gt;Ctrl+&lt;/code&gt; shortcuts in Gnome Terminal &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, that is where I started. It became apparent that configuring Gnome Terminal to handle all the shortcuts is too painful and I decided to switch to WezTerm &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; instead.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Keeping a Mid-2011 MacBook Air Running With Linux</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have a 2011 vintage MacBook Air that has not seen much usage recently. It was originally purchased from a previous employer&amp;rsquo;s auction of used computers. It did just enough things right - browsing, watching videos, working on documents, and writing some code in a pinch. Somewhere along the way, the battery stopped holding a charge and the MacBook became tethered to a power cable. This led me to replacing the battery - it was easy enough using tools, replacement battery and excellent instructions from iFixit&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Using GitHub and Bitbucket issues for comments on Static sites</title>
      <link>https://sadique.io/blog/2025/11/24/using-github-and-bitbucket-issues-for-comments-on-static-sites/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2025 11:49:27 -0800</pubDate>
      <guid>https://sadique.io/blog/2025/11/24/using-github-and-bitbucket-issues-for-comments-on-static-sites/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;One thing that statically generated sites like this typically lack is a commenting system. There are solutions like Disqus that you can embed, but then the commenter will need to create an account there, and you now have one more dependency. Sometimes, that is a perfectly reasonable approach.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I came up with an approach &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; that uses GitHub issues and Bitbucket issues to host comments.&#xA;Since this site is hosted on GitHub, and most people who would leave a comment on this site have a GitHub account, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel like another account to sign up for. And for those who don&amp;rsquo;t have a GitHub account, the approach supports Bitbucket as well.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;From 2014 to 2023, I kept track of all our finances, in one way or another. I started out with Intuit&amp;rsquo;s Mint - it did a good job of aggregating accounts and presenting consolidated views. At some point, I became weary of Intuit having passwords to all my financial accounts and decided to keep track of everything in a Google Sheet, fronted by a Google Form to enter data.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Rendering PlantUML Diagrams in Hugo</title>
      <link>https://sadique.io/blog/2025/11/20/rendering-plantuml-diagrams-in-hugo/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This blog is generated using Hugo &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. I have always wished that it had a way to render PlantUML diagrams &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. I am not alone in wishing for this - this is a feature that people have requested for over 5 years for now &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. But because of the peculiarities of Hugo&amp;rsquo;s opinionated security posture &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and how PlantUML requires starting a Java process &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, it has always been rejected &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. People have found various workarounds:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Flushing Metrics in Dropwizard Commands</title>
      <link>https://sadique.io/blog/2019/08/02/flushing-metrics-in-dropwizard-commands/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 02 Aug 2019 18:19:32 -0700</pubDate>
      <guid>https://sadique.io/blog/2019/08/02/flushing-metrics-in-dropwizard-commands/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Users of Dropwizard Metrics will be familiar with &lt;code&gt;ScheduledReporter&lt;/code&gt;  - it is a nice pattern that allows metrics reporting to be off loaded to a different thread which periodically sends out the collected metrics instead of making a network call every time a metric is collected. In most use cases, this works great - especially if you are running a server.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Managing environment lifecycles for Dropwizard Commands</title>
      <link>https://sadique.io/blog/2019/07/28/managing-environment-lifecycles-for-dropwizard-commands/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 28 Jul 2019 18:29:49 -0700</pubDate>
      <guid>https://sadique.io/blog/2019/07/28/managing-environment-lifecycles-for-dropwizard-commands/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you have built background workers or other non-server applications with Dropwizard, chances are that you used the Dropwizard Command pattern. In fact, even the sever you wrote with Dropwizard executes a command - specifically &lt;code&gt;io.dropwizard.cli.ServerCommand&lt;/code&gt;. While the server command is great, sometimes you want to build applications that have all the goodies that Dropwizard offers, but you dont want to start a server. Managing Lifecycles is one example of a Dropwizard feature that works great for server applications, but needs some tweaking to get working for non-server commands.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Looking up Enum types and values in Postgres</title>
      <link>https://sadique.io/blog/2019/05/09/looking-up-enum-types-and-values-in-postgres/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 09 May 2019 17:10:23 -0700</pubDate>
      <guid>https://sadique.io/blog/2019/05/09/looking-up-enum-types-and-values-in-postgres/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this blog post, we will explore how Postgres stores Enum types and how to query for Enum types and their values. Postgres&amp;rsquo; Enum, like their counterparts in many programming languags are data types that allow only a predefined set of values to be assigned to them. An interesting difference is that compared to programming languages, Postgres does allow blanks within the values of Enums.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Viewing Sequence ownership information in Postgres</title>
      <link>https://sadique.io/blog/2019/05/07/viewing-sequence-ownership-information-in-postgres/</link>

      <guid>https://sadique.io/blog/2019/05/07/viewing-sequence-ownership-information-in-postgres/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This blog post is an exercise in identifying all the &lt;code&gt;sequences&lt;/code&gt; in a PostgreSQL database that is associated with a table column via an &lt;code&gt;OWNED BY&lt;/code&gt; relationship. Figuring out how to do this was harder than it should have been and this journals my understanding of it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Understanding trailing @ processing in SAS input</title>
      <link>https://sadique.io/blog/2019/03/23/understanding-trailing-@-processing-in-sas-input/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 23 Mar 2019 19:46:08 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://sadique.io/blog/2019/03/23/understanding-trailing-@-processing-in-sas-input/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the first things I noticed when I started poking around in SAS code is that the &lt;code&gt;input&lt;/code&gt; statement is very powerful, flexible and hence sometimes hard to understand. It can read pretty much anything in to a dataset as long as you tell it what to do.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The use of trailing &lt;code&gt;@&lt;/code&gt;s to take control of how SAS advances the input pointer is a powerful technique to read from input files where the data is laid out in non-standard formats. In this blog post, we will try to understand how trailing &lt;code&gt;@&lt;/code&gt; processing works with the help of some &lt;code&gt;infile&lt;/code&gt; statement options and the &lt;code&gt;putlog&lt;/code&gt; statement to write to the SAS log.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Importing the SASUSER datasets in SAS Studio</title>
      <link>https://sadique.io/blog/2019/03/23/importing-the-sasuser-datasets-in-sas-studio/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 23 Mar 2019 18:14:06 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://sadique.io/blog/2019/03/23/importing-the-sasuser-datasets-in-sas-studio/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been playing around with SAS for the last two weeks. I started with a SAS University Edition running on a VirtualBox instance on my MacBook, but soon realized that it was way more convenient to use a SAS OnDemand account. Having made the switch, I realized that all learning materials made references to and used examples with datsets from a library named &lt;code&gt;SASUSER&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It was not clear how to get these datasets and use them in SAS Studio. After a bunch of searches, I found &lt;a href=&#34;https://communities.sas.com/t5/SAS-Certification/How-to-get-SASUSER-library-s-data-sets/m-p/306631/highlight/true#M124&#34;&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt; that pointed at data set up scripts for these datasets. The URL it pointed to had of course been repurposed and now redirected to a marketing page. After going back through multiple versions of the page on Internet Archive, I finally managed to find a &lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20151005165134/http://support.sas.com:80/publishing/cert/basecertguide3.html&#34;&gt;snapshot&lt;/a&gt; that linked to a set up file that worked.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had the opportunity to give a talk at &lt;a href=&#34;https://summit.graphql.com/&#34;&gt;GraphQL Summit 2018&lt;/a&gt; about the experience of introducing GraphQL for our &lt;a href=&#34;https://graphql.braintreepayments.com/&#34;&gt;Payments API&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.braintreepayments.com/&#34;&gt;Braintree&lt;/a&gt;. It was well received, as far as I could tell - I received a lot of nice feedback and had great conversations with members of the community.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The slides are available here on &lt;a href=&#34;https://speakerdeck.com/sdqali/graphql-for-a-payments-api&#34;&gt;SpeakerDeck&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;del&gt;I will update this post with links to the video of my talk when it becomes available&lt;/del&gt; The video of the talk is available &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKMDBH0CWHs&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>FreeBuilder plugin for IntelliJ</title>

      <guid>https://sadique.io/blog/2018/05/05/freebuilder-plugin-for-intellij/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;My work uses &lt;a href=&#34;http://freebuilder.inferred.org/&#34;&gt;FreeBuilder&lt;/a&gt; extensively to generate the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Builder_pattern&#34;&gt;Builder&lt;/a&gt; pattern for Java classes. In addition to this, we use the generated Builder classes to deserialize the data calsses using Jackson. After a while it became tiresome to type &lt;code&gt;@FreeBuilder&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;class Builder extends ...&lt;/code&gt; everywhere. So I decided to write and IntelliJ IDEA plugin that does it for me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Command line clients for gRPC - polyglot</title>
      <link>https://sadique.io/blog/2018/04/06/command-line-clients-for-grpc-polyglot/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Polyglot was the second gRPC client that I looked at. One of the things that I liked about it is the fact that it does not need users to generate &lt;code&gt;protoset&lt;/code&gt; files. It generates the protoset files in flight every time it runs. This, combined with the fact that it is written in Java does have a disadvantage - every time the client makes a call, it has to fire up a JVM, generate protosets and make the request.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We are in the middle of considering replacing JSON over HTTP with gRPC for communication between our internal services. One of my concerns about this was how we would be able to debug and poke around things in a world where we will no longer be able to use cURL. I have been looking at cURL like command line utilities we can use to replace most of the capabilities, if not all of cURL. So far, I have looked at &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/fullstorydev/grpcurl&#34;&gt;grpcurl&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/command_line_tool.md&#34;&gt;grpc_cli&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/polyglot&#34;&gt;polyglot&lt;/a&gt; .In these blog posts, we will try and compare these tools.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A Jackson and FreeBuilder quirk</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Jackson is a great tool to have in your tool set if you deal with JSON or XML. It facilitates easy serialization and de-serialization to and from Java classes with a convenient annotation based interface. With the same set of annotations, we can achieve both XML and JSON serialization and de-serialization. With Jackson&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code&gt;data-format-xml&lt;/code&gt; it is even possible to give the same Class a different JSON and XML representation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This blog post exists purely to remind myself that Ruby&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code&gt;Net::HTTP&lt;/code&gt; expects a &lt;code&gt;host&lt;/code&gt; and a &lt;code&gt;port&lt;/code&gt; as parameters when creating a new connection and not a &lt;code&gt;url&lt;/code&gt; string.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is a story about how many layers of abstractions and indirections one works through on a daily basis as a developer and the effort required to dive through these layers, all the while ignoring the simplest of explanations of why things may have gone wrong in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Python URL manipulation revisited</title>

      <pubDate>Tue, 26 Sep 2017 04:22:39 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://sadique.io/blog/2017/09/26/python-url-manipulation-revisited/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;My &lt;a href=&#34;https://sadique.io/blog/2017/08/17/uploading-a-standalone-artifact-to-nexus-3/&#34;&gt;last blog post&lt;/a&gt; about publishing standalone files to Nexus repositories prompted me to revisit URL manipulation in Python. When I did this &lt;a href=&#34;https://sadique.io/blog/2013/09/26/decomposing-urls-in-python/&#34;&gt;the last time&lt;/a&gt;, I used Python stand library&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code&gt;urlparse&lt;/code&gt; and it did the job. This time around, I needed to do a different kind of manipulation. Given a URL, I had to set credentials on it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I started at &lt;code&gt;urlparse&lt;/code&gt; and soon realized that Python3 moved this module to &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.parse.html&#34;&gt;urllib.parse&lt;/a&gt;. That is not too bad, I thought. After playing around with it, it became clear that &lt;code&gt;urllib.parse&lt;/code&gt; can&amp;rsquo;t manipulate credentials in a URL.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The zip file had been generated by custom shell scripts that did not have a Maven, Ivy or Gradle projects to wrap them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been playing around with Kubernetes and Docker lately. To borrow the description of Kubernetes from their website,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Kubernetes is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One of the first things I did was to try and see what it would take to go from an application to deploying it. I started with a simple Java application and had to set up the development environment. These are my notes from this process. This assumes that you have docker installed on your development environment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the challenges of using storing spring sessions in Redis is that the objects that gets stored as part of a session often undergoes changes as the application evolves and these changes cause de-serialization exceptions to be thrown after a deployment when a session created before the deployment is presented to the application. This blog post discusses a method to work around this issue.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Both Spring Security and Angular JS provide support for CSRF protection. However, getting these to work together to provide protection from CSRF requires some non-obvious configuration. This blog post explains how to add CSRF protection to an application that uses Spring Security with an Angular JS front end.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Controlling Redis auto-configuration for Spring Boot Session</title>

      <guid>https://sadique.io/blog/2016/07/16/controlling-redis-auto-configuration-for-spring-boot-session/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you have been using Spring Boot, chances are that you are using the Spring Session library to handle sessions. Spring Session has the ability to persist the sessions to various data stores, including Redis. The default behaviors of Spring Boot when combined with Spring Session is to start using Redis as the session store the moment &lt;code&gt;spring-session-data-redis&lt;/code&gt; is detected in the class path, thereby making it hard to conditionally turn Redis support ON and OFF. This blog post explores why this is the default behavior and presents a solution to control this behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In parts 1 through 4 of this series, we built a Spring API that can issue a JWT when a user successfully authenticates and verify the JWT presented by the client for subsequent requests. In this blog post - the last in the series, we will build a simple Angular JS application with authentication that uses this API as the backend.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It makes it easier to search and analyze them when using tools such as the ELK Stack [^1]. JSON formatted logs make it easier to look at them when looking at how the app is behaving in real time using tools like jq [^2]. This blog post documents how to format logs as JSON in a Spring application.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is one of those blog posts about things I wish I had known before I spent a lot of time figuring out when something was not working as expected. Recently, we have been trying to extend a &lt;code&gt;WebMvcConfigurerAdapter&lt;/code&gt; to wire up an HTTP request interceptor. And things did not work as we expected it to and we learned that our understanding of how Spring behaved under this situation was wrong. This is a write up to refer back to if and when we encounter this issue again.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Two weeks ago, I was in the Scottish Highlands - soaking in the beauty of the city of Inverness, hiking through the South Loch Ness trail and traveling across the Black Isle. It was a wonderful trip - one that I wish was longer. This was a trip that invoked so many memories in me - among other things, of a man whose voice was part of growing up. A voice that traveled from the BBC Studios in the United Kingdom halfway across the globe and into a radio set in South Malabar.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently at work, we had to deprecate a domain event. This event used to represent an error scenario. However, the business had since decided that this is no longer a valid error scenario. Removing the Java class is not straight forward - since there are events of this type stored in the event store, every time the aggregate associated with this event is loaded, Axon will throw errors trying to de-serialize them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This time, we will take a look at how to achieve the same without having to depend on an exception.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Spring&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code&gt;CommandLineRunner&lt;/code&gt; provides a great mechanism to build command line applications. While this convenience is great, applications that use &lt;code&gt;CommandLineRunner&lt;/code&gt; require extra effort in some areas like integration testing. Exit codes are such an area - applications that use command line runners always report their exit code as &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; even if there are exceptions thrown. This blog post explains a way to get to programmable exit codes for such applications.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;meta content=&#34;spring, arguments, handlermethodargumentresolver, spring mvc, spring boot&#34; name=&#34;keywords&#34;&gt;&#xA;Most of the Spring controllers in the real world accept a lot of different types of parameters - Path variables, URL parameters, request headers, request body and sometimes even the entire HTTP Request object. This provides a flexible mechanism to create APIs. Spring is really good at parsing these parameters in to Java types as long as there is an ObjectMapper (like Jackson) configured to take care of the de-serialization.&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, there are situations where you want methods to receive a parameter of a particular type that has to resolved from a set of parameters–for example, an API can expect consumers to send meta data about a request in the form of headers and need a custom type to hold this information. Spring provides a convenient way to provide such custom arguments. This blog post explores this feature and how to implement it and test it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My team at work has been lately working on a data transformer that pushes information from an external system in to platform. For historical reasons the information is passed to us in the form of flat files. We have been working on a data transformer that reads information from the file and posts it into an HTTP end point.&#xA;Apache Camel &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; makes a natural choice as the base for implementing such a data transformer. The presence of ready to use components that can read files and post information to HTTP end points and the availability of a nice D.S.L. &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; makes implementation easy and straightforward. One of the things we had to spend time figuring out was how to ensure that we authenticate correctly against our target HTTP end point. This blog post takes a look at various methods we explored.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://sadique.io/blog/2015/12/15/thoughts-on-open-graph-tags/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Open Graph protocol was designed by Facebook to help content creators generate a richer preview of links to their content when they get posted in to Facebook. It was originally proposed as a simple mark up that can be adopted in platforms beyond Facebook. The Open Graph Protocol Design Decisions presentation &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; does a very good job of enumerating the motivation and design decisions made for Open Graph. I have lately been reading and experimenting with these tags and I notice a fair bit of differences when it comes to how these tags are used by different platforms.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

One of the solutions for this issue discussed in the blog post was to use the &lt;code&gt;@IntegrationTest&lt;/code&gt; annotations to inject Java system properties and use that to run the application instead of the normal command line arguments. This blog post describes how to perform this.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I first started programming, it was predominantly creating applications that utilized the C++ graphics library. I was 14 and my friends and I tried to make the most of the time we got to spend at the computer lab of the boarding school we attended. We created applications that drew pretty, often animated pictures on the screen and not much else. This taught us basics, but our learning lacked any kind of structure. We read and figured out just enough to do what we wanted to do. There was no guidance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Implementing custom annotations for Spring MVC</title>

      <description>&lt;meta content=&#34;spring, annotation, custom annotation, spring mvc, spring boot&#34; name=&#34;keywords&#34;&gt;&#xA;I often have to work with Spring MVC based code bases that have been living for a while. One of the common trait of these code bases I have observed is the repeated use of the same Spring annotations to achieve the same effect again and again. A really good example of this is annotating a controller method with a combination of `@RequestMapping` and `@ResponseStatus` to set the expected request and response `Content-Type`, the request Method, response status etc. This blog post describes how to create custom Spring annotationshow to create custom annotation in spring mvc that produce the same effect as multiple Spring annotations acting together.</description>

      <description>&lt;meta content=&#34;spring, validate, request, parameters, @requestparam, spring mvc, param, validation&#34; name=&#34;keywords&#34;&gt;&#xA;Spring MVC provides a convenient way to validate inputs to API end points through the use of `JSR-303` annotations. While this mechanism works great for end points that consume a `RequestBody` (as is the case with most `POST` and `PUT` requests), it is not easy to achieve the same effect for end points that consume primitives in the form of path variables or request parameters (as is the case with most `GET` requests).</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are times when a Spring MVC end point performs asynchronous operations. Testing these end points using MockMvc can be tricky because of the asynchronous nature in which the result of the operation is eventually returned. This blog post describes how to write tests in such scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This blog post describes how to set up Tomcat to run multiple applications running as separate JVM processes, using the same Tomcat installation. This method utilizes the &lt;code&gt;CATALINA_HOME&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;CATALINA_BASE&lt;/code&gt; environment variables used by Tomcat. I have verified this method against Tomcat versions &lt;code&gt;8.0.x&lt;/code&gt;; other versions should work the same way.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Making sense of Cloud Foundry security group declarations</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Cloud Foundry allows fine grained declaration of security groups, down to IP address ranges and Ports. While this provides great flexibility, making sense of why each rule in a security group exists and what each does is really difficult because of the limitations of the security group declaration mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Making a map that shows a disputed territory can be a tricky business. Nation states vigorously contest maps that appear to portray a boundary that challenges what a border looks like. From the Falkland Islands to Kuril Islands; from Western Sahara to Arunachal Pradesh, disputed territories result in omissions, additions and inaccuracies in maps.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I grew up looking at maps in books printed by the Oxford Press, that came with a disclaimer in blue rubber stamped across them that stated how the map was wrong. This was due to the fact that the maps showed only the parts of Kashmir being administered by India, thereby omitting areas under Chinese and Pakistani control. The Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1961 in India makes it punishable with imprisonment up to 6 months to publish a map that excludes all or parts of Kashmir&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been playing around with maps a lot these days and have ended up using various tools in the process. This blog post is a way to make a note of these tools for later use.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;geojsonio&#34;&gt;geojson.io&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Mapbox&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://geojson.io/&#34;&gt;geojson.io&lt;/a&gt; is a simple tool for creating, editing and sharing maps. It lets you import map data in various formats and has an editor to modify maps.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;geojson-topojson&#34;&gt;GeoJSON-TopoJSON&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/JeffPaine&#34;&gt;Jeff Paine&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/JeffPaine/geojson-topojson&#34;&gt;GeoJSON-TopoJSON&lt;/a&gt; is a simple tool to convert between the more common GeoJSON format and the TopoJSON format used by libraries like D3.js. It is a simple tool, but it does exactly what it says on the tin.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Importing the Yelp dataset into MongoDB</title>

      <guid>https://sadique.io/blog/2014/08/02/importing-the-yelp-dataset-into-mongodb/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today Yelp announced their dataset challenge &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The dataset they released includes data from 5 cities (Phoenix, Las Vegas, Madison, Waterloo and Edinburgh) and consists of&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;42,153 businesses&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;320,002 business attributes&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;31,617 check-in sets&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;252,898 users&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;955,999 edge social graph&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;403,210 tips&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;1,125,458 reviews&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The data is available for public consumption, although Yelp owns any derivative dataset you create from the original &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The data is available as files with each line representing a JSON object. Since I am using MongoDB these days to analyze geospatial data, I wanted to convert this into an easy format that I could import into Mongo. Mongo puts a strict constraint on how a location needs to be specified - It expects a location field in a document to be an array in the format &lt;code&gt;[longitude, latitude]&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been playing around with Clojure and after familiarising myself with the core, I decided to start writing little programs that forces me to choose the right idioms. I am starting off with Levenshtein edit distance of two strings.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;levenshtein-edit-distance&#34;&gt;Levenshtein edit distance&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Levenshtein edit distance between two string is a way of quantifying how similar or dissimilar they are, lower distance implying higher similarity. The algorithm to calculate Levenshtein distance is fairly simple - the algorithm cares about three operations that can be performed at a particular position in a string to move it towards the other - insertion, deletion and substitution.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;meta content=&#34;jmeter, login&#34; name=&#34;keywords&#34;&gt;&#xA;I had to set up a JMeter test last week - the test included logging in to a site, and then hitting a bunch of URLs, all of them being GET requests. I found it hard to find a simple documentation that described how to do this - the ones I found were either incomplete or were trying to teach me a large number of things at the same time. So when I figured it out, I decided to write this down, for anyone else finding themselves in the same place as me.&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For this example, the application under test is a simple Rails application, with the login form at &lt;code&gt;/login&lt;/code&gt; and a &lt;code&gt;POST&lt;/code&gt; request to &lt;code&gt;/login&lt;/code&gt; does the authentication.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week, at the annual congregation of the Sree Narayana Dharma Paripalana (S.N.D.P.) Yogam, it&amp;rsquo;s leaders - Vellaapalli Nadesan and his son Thushaar announced that the Yogam is about to form their own political party that will unite Hindus of Kerala under one umbrella. &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; S.N.D.P. and it&amp;rsquo;s leaders are no strangers to threatening to announce their intent to form a political party. &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; They did the same in 2012, generating much talk in Kerala&amp;rsquo;s political landscape. The latest announcement is likely to suffer the same fate as these earlier announcements. To understand why the Yogam is highly unlikely to form a party of their own, one needs to look at the time when they indeed had their own political party - to the late 1970s; and the 1980 election to the Kerala legislature.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I thought it was the other calculation. You are right!&amp;rdquo;. You suddenly feel happy and detect the smugness creeping to your face. I was right, I told you so, you want to say. But you don&amp;rsquo;t. &amp;ldquo;Not today! The smugness will have to die.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As the thick rain drops fall on your naked torso, causing that ever so little note of pain that you have come to like and seek, you roll the muddy football under your feet and look up. Hands go up on the right flank and the young lad hugging his touch line is impatient and the wave of his hands are frantic. You turn your head and survey the left flank. Nothing going there, you quickly realise.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;All of us have opinions-some strong, some weak; some we care deeply about, some we couldn&amp;rsquo;t care less. We often express those opinions to others and sometimes people agree, sometimes they don&amp;rsquo;t. Debating with others about our opinions helps us crystallise or completely discard them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am fairly opinionated about a lot of things and have debates about them with friends and co-workers. Yet when it comes to opinions on the Internet, I shy away. Every single day, I come across issues and incidents about which I have opinions and every time I stare at what somebody else wrote, consider replying and ultimately close the tab after a minute. This happens on almost all the Internet communities I frequent - Twitter, Guardian&amp;rsquo;s Comment is Free, Guardian&amp;rsquo;s Football blogs and Hacker News.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

However, as pointed out in the improvements section, the implementation was not complete - it did not provide clients enough information about the rate limiting that is in place and how long they should wait before making further requests once they hit the limit.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Rate limiting is often put in place to prevent the hogging of resources by a sub set of the users of the system. Rate limiting works by responding with error messages when a client exceeds their allocated share of requests within a predefined time window. In addition to the error message, the response should also include information as to when rate limit will be reset so that the client can continue accessing the system after the reset.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

After a lot of scratching our heads and reading the Python documentation, we came across the &lt;code&gt;property&lt;/code&gt; function. We were able to use this to hack together a solution that ensures that every time an attribute is read, it returns the result of executing a method.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been playing around with Canvas objects and images for a side project I am doing. One of the first things I had to figure out for this project was how to fit an image of arbitrary height and width on to a Canvas object of arbitrary, but known dimensions while preserving the aspect ratios of the image. This blog post is an explanation of the solution I came up with for this.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

(You should try it. If you share stuff from the web like I do, it will save you a lot of time and frustration). I have been coding on &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/studio.html&#34;&gt;Android Studio&lt;/a&gt;, Google&amp;rsquo;s IntelliJ based IDE for Android development. It uses Gradle for build scripts. Gradle is a Groovy based DSL &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; for declaratively specifying build tasks. From what I have seen so far, it looks like an improvement over Ant.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Continuing from the last &lt;a href=&#34;https://sadique.io/blog/2013/10/01/accessing-environment-variables-in-gradle/&#34;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;, I have been looking at reading user input from a Gradle script. This was a result of Stack Overflow user &lt;em&gt;user672009&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18328730/how-to-create-a-release-signed-apk-file-using-gradle/19130098#19130098&#34;&gt;question&lt;/a&gt; about prompting for input from a Gradle script so the one does not have to include passwords in the script while checking in.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Just like the last example, the fact that Gradle scripts are written in a Groovy DSL comes to our help. Groovy&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code&gt;System. console(). readLine&lt;/code&gt; can be called from inside Gradle tasks. The same recipe from the last post can be rewritten to prompt for various parameters.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Ruby, Named Capture Groups and Local Variables</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ruby&amp;rsquo;s regular expressions support &lt;a href=&#34;https://sadique.io/blog/2013/09/29/named-capture-groups-in-regular-expressions/&#34;&gt;named capture groups&lt;/a&gt;, since 1.9. However, there is a weird behaviour while using named capture groups with the &lt;code&gt;Regexp#=~&lt;/code&gt; method. When named capture groups are used with &lt;code&gt;=~&lt;/code&gt;, the captured values are placed in local variables with the same name as the capture group. The following example demonstrates this:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#586e75;background-color:#eee8d5;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-ruby&#34; data-lang=&#34;ruby&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#93a1a1;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;#!/usr/bin/env ruby&lt;/span&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#268bd2&#34;&gt;month&lt;/span&gt; = &lt;span style=&#34;color:#2aa198&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;January&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#268bd2&#34;&gt;test_string&lt;/span&gt; = &lt;span style=&#34;color:#2aa198&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;Today&amp;#39;s date is: 9/28/2013.&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#2aa198&#34;&gt;/(?&amp;lt;month&amp;gt;\d{1,2})\/(?&amp;lt;day&amp;gt;\d{1,2})\/(?&amp;lt;year&amp;gt;\d{4})/&lt;/span&gt; =~ &lt;span style=&#34;color:#268bd2&#34;&gt;test_string&lt;/span&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#cb4b16&#34;&gt;puts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#268bd2&#34;&gt;month&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span style=&#34;color:#268bd2&#34;&gt;inspect&lt;/span&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This when executed will print &lt;code&gt;9&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Named Capture Groups in Regular Expressions</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I will admit that I find regular expressions somewhat hard to parse. While the thinking process needed to write a regular expression is iterative and hence results in the correct expression suitable for the situation, once it is written it lacks readability. I have faced that pain of trying to grok a complex regular expression written years ago. So I was pleasantly surprised when I saw &lt;a href=&#34;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6463144&#34;&gt;this example&lt;/a&gt; from Hacker News user &lt;em&gt;WestCoastJustin&lt;/em&gt;. I found it very easy to understand because of the names he had assigned to each capture group in the expression.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What would you like to have today?&amp;rdquo; The lady at the counter cheerfully asks. I smile back at her, take another cursory glance at the menu and with a sigh say &amp;ldquo;I will take the Teriyaki Salmon Sandwich, please!&amp;rdquo;. I take another look at all the menu and can&amp;rsquo;t help notice how sad I am. The assortment of meat preparations bundled between two pieces of bread that could have been mine is long and diverse. I suck my teeth and promise myself that I will be paying the butcher a visit in the evening.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Shared history in Bash</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the features that I miss most in Bash is the shared history between terminals that Zsh supports. I was hunting down a solution for this and came across this Stack Overflow answer &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; by user &lt;em&gt;lesmana&lt;/em&gt;. This code snippet does the trick:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#586e75;background-color:#eee8d5;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#268bd2&#34;&gt;HISTSIZE&lt;/span&gt;=&lt;span style=&#34;color:#2aa198;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;9000&lt;/span&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#268bd2&#34;&gt;HISTFILESIZE&lt;/span&gt;=&lt;span style=&#34;color:#268bd2&#34;&gt;$HISTSIZE&lt;/span&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#268bd2&#34;&gt;HISTCONTROL&lt;/span&gt;=ignorespace:ignoredups&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;history() {&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  _bash_history_sync&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#cb4b16&#34;&gt;builtin&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#cb4b16&#34;&gt;history&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#2aa198&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#268bd2&#34;&gt;$@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#2aa198&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;}&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;_bash_history_sync() {&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#cb4b16&#34;&gt;builtin&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#cb4b16&#34;&gt;history&lt;/span&gt; -a         &lt;span style=&#34;color:#93a1a1;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;#1&lt;/span&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#268bd2&#34;&gt;HISTFILESIZE&lt;/span&gt;=&lt;span style=&#34;color:#268bd2&#34;&gt;$HISTSIZE&lt;/span&gt;     &lt;span style=&#34;color:#93a1a1;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;#2&lt;/span&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#cb4b16&#34;&gt;builtin&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#cb4b16&#34;&gt;history&lt;/span&gt; -c         &lt;span style=&#34;color:#93a1a1;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;#3&lt;/span&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#cb4b16&#34;&gt;builtin&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#cb4b16&#34;&gt;history&lt;/span&gt; -r         &lt;span style=&#34;color:#93a1a1;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;#4&lt;/span&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;}&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#268bd2&#34;&gt;PROMPT_COMMAND&lt;/span&gt;=&lt;span style=&#34;color:#2aa198&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;_bash_history_sync;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#268bd2&#34;&gt;$PROMPT_COMMAND&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#2aa198&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is very hacky—This setting overrides the shell prompt to sync history every time the prompt is loaded. But like all great hacks, it works.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Managing Gemsets in Rbenv</title>
      <link>https://sadique.io/blog/2013/09/12/managing-gemsets-in-rbenv/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 12 Sep 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://sadique.io/blog/2013/09/12/managing-gemsets-in-rbenv/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I was setting up my new laptop today, I decided to use Rbenv &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; to manage my Ruby versions. I have typically used RVM &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and had never used Rbenv. Rbenv is a Ruby version manager written by &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sstephenson/&#34;&gt;Sam Stephenson&lt;/a&gt; and deliberately tries to do less and do it well. Instead of overriding Bash commands like RVM does, Rbenv chooses to use wrappers or &lt;strong&gt;shims&lt;/strong&gt; around Ruby binaries to choose the Ruby executable to run.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This works well, until you have to manage Gemsets &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Often, one is working on two projects that use the same version of Ruby, but has entirely different chain of dependency on Gems. RVM&amp;rsquo;s gemsets work really well for this use case. I was looking around to see how one would manage gemsets with Rbenv. There are three ways to do it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Looking up Compiler params used to compile a Ruby version</title>

      <guid>https://sadique.io/blog/2013/09/08/looking-up-compiler-params-used-to-compile-a-ruby-version/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/kgrz&#34;&gt;Kashyap&lt;/a&gt; asked how one can identify the compiler parameters passed when compiling a Ruby version. I was curious how to achieve this and like any confused developer started searching for and looking in the Ruby documentation. Searching for &lt;strong&gt;compiler parameters in ruby&lt;/strong&gt; did not yield any interesting results and the group of constants with the &lt;code&gt;RUBY_&lt;/code&gt; prefix &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; loaded in Ruby did not include anything related to compiler flags. Then I came across this blog post &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; by &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/happycode&#34;&gt;Jan Lelis&lt;/a&gt; and I was curious what else &lt;code&gt;RbConfig::CONFIG&lt;/code&gt; contains. This hash contains all the compiler flags used to compile the current Ruby VM.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Navigating Stacktraces in Emacs</title>
      <link>https://sadique.io/blog/2013/08/22/navigating-stacktraces-in-emacs/</link>

      <guid>https://sadique.io/blog/2013/08/22/navigating-stacktraces-in-emacs/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had to debug an issue today and that meant dealing with Rails stack traces. I got tired of having to constantly switch between reading the trace in the terminal and the code in Emacs to figure out what was going wrong and get more context around it. I felt that there should be an easier way of doing this. A quick search &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; did not yield anything. But then I remembered Grep mode &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and it occurred to me that hijacking Grep mode&amp;rsquo;s navigation feature would let me navigate the stack trace better. This is the solution I came up with.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Mathew Butterick&amp;rsquo;s Practical Typography &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; features a section dedicated to the History of Times New Roman &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. It is an interesting read.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Why not? Fame has a dark side. When Times New Roman appears in a book, document, or advertisement, it connotes apathy. It says, “I submitted to the font of least resistance.” Times New Roman is not a font choice so much as the absence of a font choice, like the blackness of deep space is not a colour. To look at Times New Roman is to gaze into the void.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>My Tinfoil setup</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I try to be careful when I use the internet. This is not because I do illegal stuff—I just don&amp;rsquo;t like the idea of random websites tracking me across the web, recording everything I do, and then serving me advertisements. I don&amp;rsquo;t like the idea of technocracies like Facebook collecting and storing data about me, even after I have explicitly quit their colourful walled garden. &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; I don&amp;rsquo;t like Google tracking what websites I read by pretending to provide a service to the creators of those websites in the form of CDN and Analytics. &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; I don&amp;rsquo;t want marketing optimisation services to track me and put me in their funnel, unless I explicitly want to.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This means that when I browse the web, I treat cookies, javascript code and third party content with suspicion. Over the years, my setup has evolved in to something that makes my internet use safe, all the while being useful. These are some of the things I do to ensure that sites are not tracking me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Python&#39;s bool type</title>
      <link>https://sadique.io/blog/2013/08/15/pythons-bool-type/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Python does not have a true boolean type. The &lt;code&gt;True&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;False&lt;/code&gt; built-in values in Python are wrappers around the integers &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;. This results in some interesting results involving True and False.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#586e75;background-color:#eee8d5;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34; data-lang=&#34;python&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#859900;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;True&lt;/span&gt; == &lt;span style=&#34;color:#2aa198;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#859900;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#859900;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;False&lt;/span&gt; == &lt;span style=&#34;color:#2aa198;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#859900;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#859900;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;True&lt;/span&gt; + &lt;span style=&#34;color:#2aa198;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#2aa198;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#859900;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;False&lt;/span&gt; - &lt;span style=&#34;color:#2aa198;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;-&lt;span style=&#34;color:#2aa198;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#cb4b16&#34;&gt;str&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#859900;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;)&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#2aa198&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;True&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#cb4b16&#34;&gt;repr&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#859900;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;)&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#2aa198&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;True&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Python bool implementation got formalised in PEP 285 &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; in 2002 by Guido van Rossum. The specification gives a lot of insight into von Rossum&amp;rsquo;s insistence on maintaining backward compatibility and the Python way. It also touches up on another aspect of truthness in Python. In Python, almost all objects can be used to represent truth values. This means an empty list is false and a non-empty list is true.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>When Link titles were for the early adopters</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;While doing some reading up on the comparative merits of using footnotes and hyperlinks in web pages, I came across an article &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; from 1998 by Jakob Nielsen &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; about using the then nascent &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;em&gt;title&lt;/em&gt; attribute on hyperlinks to inform users as to where clicking on a URL is going to take them. It is a very interesting read and makes passionate if not compelling arguments in favour of using the title attribute to improve the usability of a web page.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is something interesting in the article that made me think about the evolution of the web. To quote:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;early-adoption-of-link-titles-recommended&#34;&gt;Early Adoption of Link Titles Recommended&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Normally, I advise against using new Web technologies for the first year after they have been introduced. In most cases, using anything new is asking for trouble and will alienate users with older browsers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Link titles are an exception to the need to wait a year. First, their use does not hurt users with browsers that don&amp;rsquo;t display link titles (assuming you follow the guideline to keep the link anchor understandable when the link title is not displayed). Second, a browser that does not understand link titles will simply skip them. Since the title is not a new tag or otherwise intended to influence the layout of the page, the page will look exactly the same whether or not the browser does anything with the link titles. The only downside is that link titles will add approximately 0.1 seconds to the download time for a typical Web page over a modem connection. This is a rather harsh penalty, but worth paying because of the increased navigation usability for those users who do get to see the link titles.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have previously &lt;a href=&#34;https://sadique.io/blog/2012/07/17/social-networks-and-url-shorteners/&#34;&gt;written&lt;/a&gt; about &lt;a href=&#34;https://sadique.io/blog/2012/08/23/dear-content-creator-your-url-shortener-is-pointless/&#34;&gt;how social networks&lt;/a&gt; use URL shortening as a way of obscuring and swallowing information about sharing of content on their platform. In Twitter&amp;rsquo;s case, this means that all URLs are automatically &amp;lsquo;shortened&amp;rsquo; with their &lt;em&gt;t.co&lt;/em&gt; domain. All their official clients take this shortening into account when you create a Tweet so as to avoid a round trip across the network to figure out if the tweet is short enough. But what happens if you are posting a URL that does not require any shortening? Something interesting happens.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;From Kara Swisher&amp;rsquo;s well written &lt;a href=&#34;http://allthingsd.com/20130807/dear-jeff-bezos-heres-what-i-saw-as-an-analog-nobody-in-the-mailroom-of-the-washington-post/?mod=thisweek&#34;&gt;open letter to Jeff Bezos&lt;/a&gt; in the light of the latter&amp;rsquo;s announcement that he has bought the Washington Post:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To me, the most important trick is to deeply inculcate the joy of Internet journalism, without losing (actually restoring to some degree, after recent cutbacks) the great editorial values and breakthrough journalism of the Post. Fusing the old-media storytelling and news-integrity values that I learned at the Post with the Internet values of speed and personality — and, well, some level of fun at the right times — is critical.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In other words, make it clear that it is possible to do great journalism in an Internet way — even more possible because you’re freer and, most of all, readers want to read it that way. That entails inspiring the staffers of the newspaper to create content that is — as it has been — accurate, ethically sound, of high quality, but also much more compelling, and delivered in a way that modern customers want to consume it. Formulate those big stories primarily on the Web, and allow a conversation with readers to bubble up from there.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I love Biriyani. That is an understatement. I absolutely love Biriyani.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It started when I was very young. In fact, as far back as I can remember, I have loved Biriyani. A lot of people in my family - my father, a paternal uncle and his wife were cooks, and specialists in cooking for special occasions. In Malabar, that meant people employed them to cook at weddings, engagements, &lt;em&gt;Iftars&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Parasavathinu Kontu Pokals&lt;/em&gt; &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Mudikalachils&lt;/em&gt; &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. They would cook up a storm of Biryani, &lt;em&gt;Neychor&lt;/em&gt; &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Porotta&lt;/em&gt; &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Pathiri&lt;/em&gt; &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and curries of beef, chicken and mutton. Of all these things, the Biriyanis were the best.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

A detour into the murky history of Yemeni telecommunications is necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>

      <title>My thoughts on Android fragmentation -  It is not a bad thing</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;OpenSignal released the July 2013 edition &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; of their State of Android report. Among many things like the dominance of Samsung, HTC&amp;rsquo;s faltering performance and Motorola&amp;rsquo;s struggle, it points out that the Android device landscape is more fragmented than ever. Out of &lt;em&gt;682000&lt;/em&gt; devices surveyed for the report, &lt;em&gt;11868&lt;/em&gt; distinct devices were seen. This has met with cries of anguish from Developers and the usual suspects &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is a very important point in the OpenSignal report that gets ignored or does not get as much focus as it deserves. To quote:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For consumers, extreme fragmentation means that they can get exactly the phone they want – big or small, cheap or expensive, with any number of different feature combinations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Like most people, I like certain songs for their ability to bring back memories of times, places and people from the past that you don&amp;rsquo;t everyday bring out from the cellars of time, wipe away the cobwebs and dust and gaze at. &lt;em&gt;Kannu Nattu Kaathirunnittum&lt;/em&gt; &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; from the movie &lt;em&gt;Kathaavasheshan&lt;/em&gt; &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; evokes memories of childhood, the daily struggle to survive and the inability to resist the hegemony of those around you who call the shots. But, there are not many songs that does it for me quite like the Malayalam song &lt;em&gt;Alliyaambal Kadavil&lt;/em&gt; &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Emacs hack: Viewing Git logs while composing commit messages</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I use Emacs as my editor to compose Git commit messages. I almost never commit from the terminal with &lt;code&gt;git commit -m&lt;/code&gt;. This approach has two advantages: I get a chance to verify what is being committed and get to compose the message using a proper editor complete with spell checking provided by &lt;em&gt;flyspell mode&lt;/em&gt;. One thing I wish I had access to while composing commit messages is the git log. This is useful to refer to work items and encourages one to use a consistent style in the messages. This was easier in the terminal as one could do something like &lt;code&gt;git log -n 3&lt;/code&gt; and then commit with the &lt;code&gt;-m&lt;/code&gt; flag.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;TL;DR -&#xA;Use the &lt;code&gt;core.commentchar&lt;/code&gt; configuration to change the character Git uses to mark comment lines in commit messages.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My team has a convention of putting the number of the current Issue/Ticket/Story that we are working on at the beginning of every commit message. This is great because it lets us make sense of the history of our code by helping us answer&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;What were the changes made to the code base to build a feature or fix an issue?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Given a changeset, why was it put in place?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We use the format &lt;code&gt;#123 Foo bar&lt;/code&gt; for the message where &lt;code&gt;123&lt;/code&gt; is the issue number because it lets &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thoughtworks-studios.com/mingle&#34;&gt;Mingle&lt;/a&gt;, our project management tool track the commits made against each card.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>My experience working remotely</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There has been a lot of debate in the tech community about working remotely and the willingness of employers to allow this option to their employees. At the very beginning of my career as a programmer, I had the opportunity to work on a distributed team. While the team was distributed, I was still working from an office and for almost half of the duration of my work on the team I had team members sitting beside me in the same office. Because of this, my scenario may not be representative of the population of programmers who work remotely. However, there are a number of things I learned from the experience that I would like to share.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Oh, is this what you guys have been building for three years? I can build it in a month!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Substitute the two time durations with something appropriate and you end up with how some software developers react after encountering a new project or application. I have seen this happen in multiple situations, where I had more context of how the application in question had evolved which the person making the comment did not have.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>JavaScript, clipboard access and hidden flash widgets</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Letting users copy text and URLs from a webpage effortlessly is one of those things that sound easy in theory, but is a pain when it comes to implementation. Browsers take great efforts to ensure that web pages are sand boxed in such a way that a web application can not read from or write to the system&amp;rsquo;s clipboard without jumping through hoops. Firefox asks you to change browser configurations to give web applications access to the system clipboard, while Internet Explorer shows a modal dialog to confirm that you really want to allow the application access. This diminishes any user experience gains made by implementing this feature in the first place. Brook Novak has a very good article about JavaScript and the clipboard &lt;a href=&#34;http://brooknovak.wordpress.com/2009/07/28/accessing-the-system-clipboard-with-javascript/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I use Emacs as my primary text editor and I use it to edit&#xA;commit messages for Git. I almost never use the &lt;code&gt;-m&lt;/code&gt;&#xA;option with &lt;code&gt;git commit&lt;/code&gt;. Since I have a fairly customised Emacs&#xA;configuration based around Sam Aaron&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/overtone/emacs-live&#34;&gt;Emacs Live&lt;/a&gt;, this means that&#xA;for every commit, there is a visible delay for Emacs to start up for the&#xA;commit message. I was looking for ways to reduce this and figured out that&#xA;running Emacs in &lt;code&gt;daemon&lt;/code&gt; mode and using &lt;code&gt;emacsclient&lt;/code&gt; as the&#xA;&lt;code&gt;GIT_EDITOR&lt;/code&gt; would solve this.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I moved to San Francisco last week and is just getting acquainted with&#xA;the city. This blog&#xA;post is a summary of my first impressions of SF to share with a lot of friends whom I have not been able to keep in touch and who have been wondering what I am up to.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;it-is-cold-here&#34;&gt;It is cold here&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I landed in SF without enough winter wear. I had a windbreaker that I&#xA;used in Bangalore and provided more than adequate warmth back in&#xA;Bangalore. Soon, I realised that it won&amp;rsquo;t be enough. Temperatures were&#xA;under 10 C. I had to get a proper jacket.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I released my &lt;a href=&#34;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/getcache-ff/&#34;&gt;first Firefox plugin&lt;/a&gt; today. It&#xA;is awaiting review, but if you are adventurous, you can install it right&#xA;now. Go on, try it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After I had written the &lt;a href=&#34;https://sadique.io/blog/2012/11/28/getcache-a-chrome-plugin-to-view-cached-version-of-the-current-page/&#34;&gt;Chrome version&lt;/a&gt; yesterday, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/ManishChaks&#34;&gt;Manish&lt;/a&gt; suggested&#xA;that I should write one for Firefox. There already exist Firfox plugins&#xA;that does exactly what GetCache does, but I decided to go ahead and write it&#xA;for fun. And of course, the fact that I could publish it without having&#xA;to sign up with my Credit Card information was enticing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Download the plugin&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://sadique.io/downloads/GetCache.crx&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On numerous occasions, I have ran in to the situation where I had to&#xA;look up how to load Google&amp;rsquo;s cached version of a particular page. This&#xA;happens often when I follow a link from Hacker News or Reddit to a blog&#xA;post and the blog has went down due to the great avalanche of traffic&#xA;from HN and Reddit.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After struggling to remember and having to Google how to get the cached&#xA;version, I decided to finally solve this issue. I wrote &lt;code&gt;GetCache&lt;/code&gt;, a&#xA;dead simple Google Chrome plugin that loads Google&amp;rsquo;s cached version of&#xA;the current page.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;installing&#34;&gt;Installing&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can download the plugin&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://sadique.io/downloads/GetCache.crx&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. In order to install it, open your&#xA;Extensions page (&lt;code&gt;Window -&amp;gt; Extensions&lt;/code&gt;) and drag the downloaded &lt;code&gt;CRX&lt;/code&gt;&#xA;file to the page.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>On REST, Content-Type, Google Chrome and Caching</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Representational State Transfer (REST) is a style of software&#xA;architecture for distributed systems that has replaced technologies like&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP&#34;&gt;SOAP&lt;/a&gt; as the predominant Web service&#xA;design model. Originally proposed by Roy Fielding in his &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm&#34;&gt;Doctorate&#xA;dissertation&lt;/a&gt;,&#xA;REST puts a lot of emphasis on resources, their representations and states. Basically a URL indicates a&#xA;single resource; the HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) indicates what&#xA;action should be performed on that resource; and the ACCEPT header indicates the format that the resource should be presented in.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;chrome-and-content-type&#34;&gt;Chrome and Content-Type&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Having seen this, one would assume that if you have a resource, say a&#xA;&lt;code&gt;User&lt;/code&gt; on your system and there were two representations of that&#xA;resource - HTML and JSON. Let&amp;rsquo;s assume that the HTML representation does&#xA;an AJAX call to fetch the JSON representation and renders it. While this&#xA;sounds simple enough, Google Chrome, one of the world&amp;rsquo;s most popular&#xA;browsers&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=108766&#34;&gt;totally breaks this&lt;/a&gt;. A&#xA;good example of this weird behaviour can be seen &lt;a href=&#34;http://chrome-json-bug.heroku.com/docs&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How Browsers Detect If You Are Offline</title>

      <guid>https://sadique.io/blog/2012/11/22/how-browsers-detect-if-you-are-offline/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I saw the newly released&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;http://oskarkrawczyk.github.com/heyoffline.js/&#34;&gt;Heyoffline.js&lt;/a&gt; library,&#xA;I was curious to see how it figured out if the user was online or&#xA;not. This led me to the &lt;code&gt;window.navigator.onLine&lt;/code&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/window.navigator.onLine&#34;&gt;API&lt;/a&gt; and how&#xA;different browsers implement it. Chrome, Safari and Inernet Explorer 10&#xA;make sure that the API detects if the user is connected to a network,&#xA;while Firefox changes this flag if and only if the user chooses the&#xA;&lt;code&gt;Work Offline&lt;/code&gt; option. A detailed discussion of this difference in&#xA;implementation is available&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;http://schalk-neethling.com/2011/05/navigator-online-and-the-differing-implementations-of-a-standard/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Dear Content Creator, Your URL Shortener Is Pointless</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;People love URL shorteners. They are everywhere. You can use one of&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;http://goo.gl&#34;&gt;the giants&lt;/a&gt;, or use one of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://bit.ly&#34;&gt;URL Shortening As A Service&lt;/a&gt; options available&#xA;or you can run one on your own.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But none of that matters. Apart from adding to the redirect hell&#xA;prevalent on the web today and giving you a minor branding push, custom&#xA;URL shorteners does not add anything.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;People started using these shortening services because of two&#xA;reasons. The first reason was the necessity to share&#xA;ugly URLs like&#xA;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://example.com/reports.php?start=2001&amp;amp;end=2010&amp;amp;item=Foo%20bar&#34;&gt;http://example.com/reports.php?start=2001&amp;amp;end=2010&amp;amp;item=Foo%20bar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and&#xA;they wanted to make it easier on the eyes of people. The second reason&#xA;was the limit on the number of characters allowed in a post by micro blogging services&#xA;like Twitter and Identi.ca.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Giving up the Samba for the Tiki-taka</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A shot flew over the bar. The goal keeper showed great urgency in&#xA;collecting the ball from behind the goal. Instead of kicking it forward, he pushed the ball&#xA;gently out to the centre back. As the opposition forward streamed&#xA;forward to close him down, the defender moved the ball swiftly and pushed it to&#xA;the right back who was level with the penalty box. Another push and the&#xA;central mid fielder was brought in to the play. A through ball to the&#xA;left found the player on the left wing and as the opposing&#xA;right back zoomed in to focus, he played it back to his left back. As&#xA;the left back controlled the ball, his&#xA;team repositioned themselves to start from scratch all over again. To build&#xA;from the back.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you have watched football in the recent past, you would recognise a&#xA;pattern here. You would see the unmistakable Barcelona blueprint. Except&#xA;that I am not describing Barcelona. Not even Spain. In fact when the&#xA;initial shot flew over the bar, there was no collective sigh of relief&#xA;from a crowd &lt;a href=&#34;%22http://mkbarcelona.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/200311-005.jpg%22&#34;&gt;packed till the heavens&lt;/a&gt;,&#xA;there was no eager ball boy to throw the ball back at the keeper and&#xA;there was no one in the dug out shouting instructions at the&#xA;players. Hell, there was not even a dug out near the touch line. The&#xA;keeper ran to the construction site where the ball had found it&amp;rsquo;s way&#xA;through and ran back all the way to get the play restarted. As he was&#xA;still was running back, the left back of my opponents walked back to his&#xA;position, his face embellished with a smile bore out of his pride&#xA;of having bent his shot around the cashew tree inside the&#xA;ground.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

For those confused as to what a&#xA;super cup, the&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_cup&#34;&gt;Wikipedia entry&lt;/a&gt; is a good&#xA;starting point. Super cups, at least in European national&#xA;leagues are curtain-raisers for the season.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The FA &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FA_Community_Shield&#34;&gt;Community Shield&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;is England&amp;rsquo;s Super Cup and it pits the winners of the FA Cup against the&#xA;winners of the Premier League from the previous season. This year&amp;rsquo;s game saw Manchester City&#xA;beat Chelsea.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Winning the Community Shield at the beginning of the&#xA;season is considered a bad omen by a lot of football fans - an indicator that the team who win it&#xA;would not win the subsequent league season. This supposed curse is&#xA;widely discussed in&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.redcafe.net/f6/curse-community-shield-165424/&#34;&gt;fan forums&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;and&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2005/jan/26/theknowledge.sport&#34;&gt;blog posts&lt;/a&gt;. And&#xA;what would be complete on the Internet without a &lt;a href=&#34;http://9gag.com/gag/5030472&#34;&gt;dinosaur thinking&#xA;aloud&lt;/a&gt; about it?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday a colleague of mine asked me if I was on Facebook. He&#xA;was genuinely surprised by my reply that I was not and he wanted to know&#xA;why. For the next 20 minutes or so, I explained to him why I quit&#xA;Facebook and does not want anything to do with it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is not the first time I have had to explain my absence from Facebook. In this post I will explain my attitude towards Facebook in a more structured manner.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Broadly, these are the points I will touch upon:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Narcissism&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Symmetric nature of sharing&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The social pressure to &amp;lsquo;friend&amp;rsquo; someone&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Low signal to noise ratio&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I did a &lt;a href=&#34;http://d3js.org&#34;&gt;d3.js&lt;/a&gt; workshop at ThoughtWorks Bangalore yesterday (31st&#xA;July, 2012). I split the workshop in to two parts. The first was a basic&#xA;introduction to d3.js - SVG, Scaling, Axes etc. The second part&#xA;was an exercise to hack together a Scatterplot with some Cricket&#xA;dataset.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Around 30 people attended the workshop. I spent too much time on the first part and hence we did not have enough&#xA;time to complete the second part. This was the first ever workshop I have done&#xA;and my time plan was way off. I should fix it the next time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Click &lt;a href=&#34;https://sadique.io/visualizations/league_champions/index.html&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the visualisation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is a visualization showing how various European football clubs have&#xA;dominated their respective national leagues over various time&#xA;periods. The visualization shows data for England, France, Germany,&#xA;Italy, Netherlands and Spain.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The visualization is self-explanatory. You can choose a league to view&#xA;from the dropdown and then choose the sliders to select an era for which you want to look&#xA;at the data. For fine adjustment, after clicking on either slider, you&#xA;can use your keyboard to select a time period.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Social Networks and their URL Shorteners</title>

      <guid>https://sadique.io/blog/2012/07/17/social-networks-and-their-url-shorteners/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been noticing lately that much of the traffic that my blog&#xA;receives comes from Twitter&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;t.co&lt;/strong&gt; domain or Google+&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;plus.url.google.com&lt;/strong&gt; domain. I don&amp;rsquo;t receive much traffic and I don&amp;rsquo;t&#xA;particularly care about the amount of traffic. However, when I&#xA;see traffic from Google+ or Twitter, I know that somebody is discussing&#xA;or sharing my posts and I am curious to know who is doing that. But if I&#xA;look at where the traffic comes from, with the hope that I will be able&#xA;to find Tweets or Google+ updates where people are talking about my&#xA;content, all I would be able to see is a &lt;strong&gt;t.co&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;plus.url.google.com&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;URL that redirects to my page. While it is mildly frustrating, I have&#xA;been thinking why both Twitter and Google+ replace every URL users share&#xA;on their network and replace it with their own URLs that does a redirect&#xA;to the original content being shared.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last Saturday,  Srijayanth Sridhar (&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/craftybones&#34;&gt;@craftybones&lt;/a&gt;) and I gave a talk at XConf, ThoughtWorks India&amp;rsquo;s internal conference series.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We talked about visualising data, and the various visualisations that one could use to answer questions about the dataset you have. We looked at two particular datasets -  one showing the consumption of juice at the fresh juice counter in office and one about Indian and Pakistani players. We looked at various visualizations like Area charts, Box Plots, Chord Diagrams, Line Charts, Pie Charts, Donut Charts, Small Multiples, Spark Lines, Stack Charts and Treemaps.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-it&#34;&gt;What is it?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Python&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code&gt;with&lt;/code&gt; statement provides a very convenient way of dealing with the situation where you have to do a setup and teardown to make something happen. A very good example for this is the situation where you want to gain a handler to a file, read data from the file and the close the file handler.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Without the &lt;code&gt;with&lt;/code&gt; statement, one would write something along the lines of:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#586e75;background-color:#eee8d5;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34; data-lang=&#34;python&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#268bd2&#34;&gt;file&lt;/span&gt; = &lt;span style=&#34;color:#cb4b16&#34;&gt;open&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#2aa198&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;/tmp/foo.txt&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;)&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#268bd2&#34;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt; = &lt;span style=&#34;color:#268bd2&#34;&gt;file&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span style=&#34;color:#268bd2&#34;&gt;read&lt;/span&gt;()&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#268bd2&#34;&gt;file&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span style=&#34;color:#268bd2&#34;&gt;close&lt;/span&gt;()&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are two annoying things here. First, you end up forgetting to close the file handler. The second is how to handle exceptions that may occur once the file handler has been obtained. One could write something like this to get around this:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#586e75;background-color:#eee8d5;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34; data-lang=&#34;python&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#268bd2&#34;&gt;file&lt;/span&gt; = &lt;span style=&#34;color:#cb4b16&#34;&gt;open&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#2aa198&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;/tmp/foo.txt&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;)&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#859900&#34;&gt;try&lt;/span&gt;:&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;    &lt;span style=&#34;color:#268bd2&#34;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt; = &lt;span style=&#34;color:#268bd2&#34;&gt;file&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span style=&#34;color:#268bd2&#34;&gt;read&lt;/span&gt;()&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#859900&#34;&gt;finally&lt;/span&gt;:&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;    &lt;span style=&#34;color:#268bd2&#34;&gt;file&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span style=&#34;color:#268bd2&#34;&gt;close&lt;/span&gt;()&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;While this works well, it is unnecessarily verbose. This is where &lt;code&gt;with&lt;/code&gt; is useful. The good thing about &lt;code&gt;with&lt;/code&gt; apart from the better syntax is that it is very good handling exceptions. The above code would look like this, when using &lt;code&gt;with&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#586e75;background-color:#eee8d5;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34; data-lang=&#34;python&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#859900&#34;&gt;with&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#cb4b16&#34;&gt;open&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#2aa198&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;/tmp/foo.txt&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;) &lt;span style=&#34;color:#859900&#34;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#268bd2&#34;&gt;file&lt;/span&gt;:&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;   &lt;span style=&#34;color:#268bd2&#34;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt; = &lt;span style=&#34;color:#268bd2&#34;&gt;file&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span style=&#34;color:#268bd2&#34;&gt;read&lt;/span&gt;()&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been doing some coding in Python recently. While playing around with some code, I noticed that the way &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Here_document&#34;&gt;heredocs&lt;/a&gt; are used in Python is different from Ruby.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;python&#34;&gt;Python&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Consider the following snippet:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#586e75;background-color:#eee8d5;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34; data-lang=&#34;python&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#93a1a1;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;# test.py&lt;/span&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#cb4b16&#34;&gt;print&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#2aa198&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;some text in single line&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#cb4b16&#34;&gt;print&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#2aa198&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&amp;#34;&amp;#34;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#2aa198&#34;&gt;As opposed to&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#2aa198&#34;&gt;some text&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#2aa198&#34;&gt;written as&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#2aa198&#34;&gt;heredoc&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#2aa198&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&amp;#34;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#cb4b16&#34;&gt;print&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#2aa198&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;and then another single line&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When run, this would result in this:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#586e75;background-color:#eee8d5;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;bash-3.2$ python test.py&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;some text in single line&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;As opposed to&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;some text&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;written as&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;heredoc&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;and &lt;span style=&#34;color:#859900&#34;&gt;then&lt;/span&gt; another single line&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notice how there is a preceding and trailing linebreak around the string printed using heredoc.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Micro Journal - simple Git-backed journal in Python</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today, I pushed out &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sdqali/microjournal&#34;&gt;Microjournal&lt;/a&gt;, a simple and lightweight journal. I wrote Microjournal to reduce the pain of typing a number of commands to create and maintain my daily journal which I type out in Emacs and use Git to store. It is a single file Python script.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Microjournal does not do much on it&amp;rsquo;s own. It creates a Git repository for you, and then you can write down entries whenever you feel like. It opens the entry for the day in your $EDITOR. It adds the current date and time to the entry so that you don&amp;rsquo;t have to manually enter it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/craftybones&#34;&gt;Srijayanth Sridhar&lt;/a&gt; and I did a talk yesterday at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thoughtworks.com/events/the-testing-spirit&#34;&gt;vodQA NCR&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The talk was about what makes maintenance of large test suites a pain and the&#xA;things that have worked for us and we have seen work for other teams.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It went well and we got a lot of good feedback from the crowd. The prezi for the talk is below:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;prezi-player&#34;&gt;&lt;style type=&#34;text/css&#34; media=&#34;screen&#34;&gt;.prezi-player { width: 550px; } .prezi-player-links { text-align: center; }&lt;/style&gt;&lt;object id=&#34;prezi_igcdltanud6-&#34; name=&#34;prezi_igcdltanud6-&#34; classid=&#34;clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000&#34; width=&#34;550&#34; height=&#34;400&#34;&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;movie&#34; value=&#34;http://prezi.com/bin/preziloader.swf&#34;/&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;allowfullscreen&#34; value=&#34;true&#34;/&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;allowFullScreenInteractive&#34; value=&#34;true&#34;/&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;allowscriptaccess&#34; value=&#34;always&#34;/&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;bgcolor&#34; value=&#34;#ffffff&#34;/&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;flashvars&#34; value=&#34;prezi_id=igcdltanud6-&amp;amp;lock_to_path=0&amp;amp;color=ffffff&amp;amp;autoplay=no&amp;amp;autohide_ctrls=0&#34;/&gt;&lt;embed id=&#34;preziEmbed_igcdltanud6-&#34; name=&#34;preziEmbed_igcdltanud6-&#34; src=&#34;http://prezi.com/bin/preziloader.swf&#34; type=&#34;application/x-shockwave-flash&#34; allowfullscreen=&#34;true&#34; allowFullScreenInteractive=&#34;true&#34; allowscriptaccess=&#34;always&#34; width=&#34;550&#34; height=&#34;400&#34; bgcolor=&#34;#ffffff&#34; flashvars=&#34;prezi_id=igcdltanud6-&amp;amp;lock_to_path=0&amp;amp;color=ffffff&amp;amp;autoplay=no&amp;amp;autohide_ctrls=0&#34;&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;prezi-player-links&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&#34;Maintaining Large Test Suites&#34; href=&#34;http://prezi.com/igcdltanud6-/maintaining-large-test-suites/&#34;&gt;Maintaining Large Test Suites&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&#34;http://prezi.com&#34;&gt;Prezi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Know Your Tools - Don&#39;t Shoot Yourself in the Foot</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Imagine this - Your build is taking forever. You put in a lot of effort and restructure it. Things improve a lot, but it is far from where you would like it to be. You try hard to identify things that could improve the build time, but fail. You blame the platforms you use, you blame Ruby and you even blame the relative position of the Moon to Venus. Slowly you learn to accept the slow build as a part of your life. Months later a new developer joins the team and proves that there is a bug in the build scripts that causes certain tasks to be run twice.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This happened to us recently, and the subsequent debugging/postmortem revealed that there were things about our tools that we simply did not know.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Managing security certificates from the console - on Windows, Mac OS X and Linux</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For me the last two weeks or so have involved a lot of wrestling with SSL certificates. One of the things that took some time to figure out was how to piggy-back on the tools provided by different Operating Systems to manage certificates. We did not want to rewrite &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mozilla.org/projects/security/pki/nss/&#34; title=&#34;NSS&#34;&gt;NSS&lt;/a&gt;. Luckily for us, all the major OSes provide tools to manage certificates from the command line.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Spiral of Learning</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;An hour ago, I was staring at a problem on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.4clojure.com/&#34; title=&#34;4clojure&#34;&gt;4clojure&lt;/a&gt; website. Last weekend, I found myself wandering through Zed Shaw&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://c.learncodethehardway.org/&#34; title=&#34;Learn C The Hard Way&#34;&gt;Learn C the Hard Way&lt;/a&gt;. Three days before that, I was taking a stab at figuring what kind of visualizations would make sense if you want to come up with the mother of all comparison&amp;rsquo;s between two of football&amp;rsquo;s greatest ever players. Four days before that, I was looking at some classifiers. Five weeks ago, I was totally lost in &lt;a href=&#34;http://learnyousomeerlang.com/&#34; title=&#34;Learn You Some Erlang For Great Good&#34;&gt;Learn You Some Erlang&lt;/a&gt;, and three weeks before that I was trying to make sense of all the hype around Node.js.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>You Crash and then You Learn</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As I picked up my bicycle, climbed on it and spotted the blood on my elbows and the bunch of curious onlookers in front of the pan shop nearby, I did not feel fear or embarrassment. I had an immeasurable amount of happiness welling inside me. I had finally done what I should have about 20 years ago - I had finally managed to crash my bicycle and leave with plenty of scars to show for it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am 25, and until two weeks ago I could not ride a bicycle. Two weeks ago, during a Saturday afternoon, I got on a bicycle and rode it around a football field. Well, what is so special about that, you might ask. It was pretty special to me because it was the first time I had rode a bicycle, where my definition of &amp;lsquo;ride&amp;rsquo; is &amp;lsquo;ride with a level of confidence that removes the fear on falling down!&amp;rsquo;. When it finally happened, it was like what Kevin Garnett &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_gL_H9zAY8&#34;&gt;described&lt;/a&gt; when he finally won an NBA with the Celtics after years of disappointment with the Minnesota Timberwolves - &amp;ldquo;I Just Knocked the Bully Out&amp;rdquo;. Yes, I was emotional. No, I did not cry. But it had been a long time coming, and the journey was painful. Here is the story of me learning to cycle.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Indian and Pakistani cricketers - who make better debuts?</title>
      <link>https://sadique.io/blog/2012/05/11/indian-and-pakistani-cricketers-who-make-better-debuts/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently a friend and I had an argument about who makes better debuts among Indian and Pakistani cricket players. Now, I am not into cricket. But I do watch the odd matches here and there and am generally aware of what is going on in the game. My stand was that Pakistani players make better debuts compared to Indian players, while my friend was adamant that Indian players make better debuts. My friend is more of a cricket guy than I ever was and he asked me what is the basis of my stand. It was just a gut feel for me and I had to leave it as there was no way for me to prove that my gut feel was correct. But I did want to try, though.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I decided to see if I could prove my theory. Luckily, Cricinfo has all this data, although they dont make it easy for you to get it. I wrote some scripts to pull this data and decided to visualise this using the awesome d3 library. In the end, this became more about figuring out d3 than winning the argument, but doing this was fun.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Fixing Flyspell for Emacs in Mac OS X</title>

      <guid>https://sadique.io/blog/2012/05/04/fixing-flyspell-for-emacs-in-mac-os-x/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I use the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/FlySpell&#34;&gt;flyspell-mode&lt;/a&gt; as a spell checking mechanism in emacs. Recently, I moved to Mac OS X, and I began to get this error whenever I started emacs:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#586e75;background-color:#eee8d5;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Error enabling Flyspell mode:&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;(Searching &lt;span style=&#34;color:#859900&#34;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; program No such file or directory aspell)&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had installed aspell with Homebrew. The issue seemed to be that Emacs was unable to find the aspell binary. Homebrew installs binaries in &lt;strong&gt;/usr/local/bin&lt;/strong&gt; and it was in my $PATH. It turns out Emacs uses it&amp;rsquo;s own exec path to look for binaries to execute in sub-processes. So the fix is to add the &lt;strong&gt;/usr/local/bin&lt;/strong&gt; path to the exec-path. This is the change needed to the &lt;strong&gt;~/.emacs&lt;/strong&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Finding un-merged commits with git cherry</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In a project that I was a part of in the recent past, we used Story Branching. While it afforded us flexibility in pulling and pushing stories in and out of releases, it has given us some scares in the past. Somebody makes commits against a story, but the commit does not get merged to the correct release branch where it is supposed to go or gets merged to another release. The solution was to hunt down the commits that are missing or have creeped in.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is where the &lt;a href=&#34;http://linux.die.net/man/1/git-cherry&#34;&gt;git cherry&lt;/a&gt; command is useful. Git cherry finds commits not merged from a branch to another. From the man page:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Every commit that doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist in the upstream branch has its id (sha1) reported, prefixed by a symbol. The ones that have equivalent change already in the upstream branch are prefixed with a minus (-) sign, and those that only exist in the head branch are prefixed with a plus (+) symbol&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>

      <title>Bullet proof Jenkins setup</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this post, I will describe how a neat setup and some discipline will ensure a Jenkins that can be rolled back and recreated very easily - a bullet proof Jenkins setup.  I have been working on configuring our Jenkins instance. This was the first time I had played around with Jenkins. I am fairly comfortable with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thoughtworks-studios.com/go-agile-release-management&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Go&lt;/a&gt; from ThoughtWorks Studios. All of my past teams used Go as their tool for continuous delivery.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One of the things I found very different from Go in Jenkins is the absence of the notion of a Pipeline as the basic entity of build, as proposed in &lt;a href=&#34;http://continuousdelivery.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Continuous Delivery&lt;/a&gt;. Although there are plugins to make this available in Jenkins, we decided to go with Jenkins&amp;rsquo; model of Jobs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My new team at work is writing a bunch of Rails applications. This is one of those codebases that one would call &amp;ldquo;legacy&amp;rdquo; without much argument. Most of these apps have their own patched, vendorized Rails versions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Getting up and running was an absolute pain. This project existed before Bundler and the list of gem dependencies are not checked in. I got the output of running &lt;code&gt;gem list&lt;/code&gt; on a colleague&amp;rsquo;s box, wrote a Ruby script to generate a shell script that installs all the gems. When I tried running the tests in one of those apps, I got a nice error.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently I spent some time debugging an issue our team was facing around some C# code making a request on one of our servers. The request was throwing a &lt;code&gt;The server committed a protocol violation. Section=ResponseStatusLine&lt;/code&gt; error.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Initial investigation suggested that this could happen if we are making HTTP/1.1 requests to a server configured for HTTP/1.0. Our Rails application runs on Mongrel fronted with nginx 0.6.5. We modified the C# code to use HTTP/1.0 and the error went away. The following line does the trick.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently did a talk on football and the politics behind it, as part of the Banyan Tree talk series at ThoughtWorks. The slides from the talk can be found &lt;a href=&#34;http://speakerdeck.com/u/sdqali/p/football-as-a-lense&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; on Speakerdeck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;It was great fun for me. I thought I did well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is a topic I know my way around. The history behind the El Clasico - the Spanish civil war, Franco, the trade unions and Di Stefano was discussed. We also looked at The Old Firm. I also talked about Athletic Bilbao&amp;rsquo;s use of football as a form of cultural resistance. The last parts of the talk were about multiculturalism, united Europe and football as a globalized game.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I joined a &lt;a href=&#34;http://pragprog.com/book/btlang/seven-languages-in-seven-weeks&#34;&gt;7 langauges in 7 weeks&lt;/a&gt; study group started by &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/#!/jocranford&#34;&gt;jocranford&lt;/a&gt; and others. The group started on 24th October, but I joined only on yesterday. The language for the first week is Ruby. I have done a fair bit of Ruby and consider myself fairly familiar with Ruby.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have managed to complete days 1 and 2 of Ruby. The book encourages one to Google, read the API and figure out stuff yourself. I have found this approach really nice because following this has enabled me to learn some stuff I did not know about Ruby.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Wikipedia Page Hopping</title>
      <link>https://sadique.io/blog/2011/05/17/wikipedia-page-hopping/</link>

      <guid>https://sadique.io/blog/2011/05/17/wikipedia-page-hopping/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have realized that like most users of Wikipedia, I do a lot of Wikipedia page-hopping [1]. Wikipedia is sort of addictive that way. You start reading about a piece of Flamenco music and after twenty minutes find yourself staring at the page about &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ETA&#34;&gt;ETA&lt;/a&gt;, a Basque nationalist organization. So I decided to figure out how I exactly do I get lost in the huge list of interconnected articles. I use Chromium, and it stores its history in a SQLite3 database file. I wrote a small Ruby script that parses the history, splits them to chunks of articles accessed per day, and filter only Wikipedia links from this.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The intense, almost mystical sound of the second set of prayers wafted through the air, following him through the wind, as if they did not want him to walk away from them. Just a shade of the thought of someone caring for him made him feel strangely happy. For a second. Soon the rational part of his brain kicked in. How much could the fast dispersing sound of prayers really care about him? They were after all waves. Waves created in the air by the reverberations of a piece of diaphragm deep inside the mouth of a tannoy at the mosque. As A would have so nonchalantly pointed out to him had he been with him, they are just a manifestation of a physical phenomenon. Of a physical phenomenon that was simple and simplistic. And the bugger would be immensely convincing, just like Paulo Coelho. Yet, the thought of someone or something caring about him sounded like elixir to him. That would be awesome, he told himself.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I use &lt;a href=&#34;http://live.gnome.org/Empathy&#34;&gt;Empathy&lt;/a&gt; as my preferred IM application. Today, I wanted to have a look at an IM conversation I had with someone. I pulled out the Empathy log corresponding to that conversation, and boom - it is in XML.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Just another excuse to write code. So I came up with the following. It was easy to write and it does not do much - It uses the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/hpricot/hpricot&#34;&gt;Hpricot gem&lt;/a&gt; to parse the XML and prints the name of the people involved in the chat and their messages in a human readable form. What? You are one of those souls who actually enjoy reading XML? Well, I am not one of those.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today, I installed Yasst. If I remember correctly, I have tried no less than 8 twitter clients. The list includes Gwibber, Choqok, Pino, Turpial and Yasst. I liked certain features in some of these clients and absolutely hated others. I have not managed to find many that I really like. I like twittering-mode a lot, although it is more of a twitter clients for Emacs, than a client for linux. This is my review of the main Linux twitter clients I have tried.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Njaan Varaam, Assalamu Alaikum&lt;/em&gt; (I will be back, Peace Be Upon You). I felt myself choking as those words escaped my mouth. And as I reached the gate and took my first step out, I heard my mother say &lt;em&gt;Wa Alaikum Assalaam&lt;/em&gt; (Peace Be Upon You, too). And then I felt the straps of the laptop bag sink into my shoulders, and it felt so heavy. It should not be. It still had the same stuff as it did when I set on my journey home on the Friday evening. In fact, it should feel lighter, as I had moved some stuff into another bag, which I was holding in my right hand. Sigh! I knew why I choked and the bag felt heavier.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently my team encountered a frustrating thing while working with a Java library in JRuby. It took us long to figure out what was going wrong. This is an attempt to write down what was happening.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You are in Ruby world, a world of weak typing, no type casting and pure bliss in coding. You forget that some languages care about the type of elements in an Array. And you end up spending a lot of time figuring out why you are staring at a stupid looking exception.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A week ago, I was running Ubuntu 9.10 on my laptop, and had a great &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmarklet&#34;&gt;bookmarklet&lt;/a&gt; that let me select any text from a webpage and post the quoted text to Twitter along with the URL to the page. The page was even shortened with tinyurl.com.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Over the last weekend, I installed Fedora 11, and in the process lost this great bookmarklet. I could not find it, after some time googling. So I decided to write my own. One of the modifications that I wanted to make was to use &lt;a href=&#34;http://bit.ly/&#34;&gt;bit.ly&lt;/a&gt; URL shortening instead of tinyurl.com. The small saving in the length of the URL generated is a real boon if you happen to do a lot of &amp;lsquo;Quote and Tweet&amp;rsquo; like me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The last time I wrote about Athletic, they were relinquishing at the bottom of the La Liga table, their record as one among the only three clubs in La Liga to have never got relegated in threat.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;More than a year later, things are really looking up at The Catedral. They managed to finish at seventh in the La Liga last season, qualifying for the Europa Liga. They are flying in Europa Liga this season, they are almost on the verge of breaking into the European qualifying positions again, they have one of La Liga&amp;rsquo;s most promising youngsters in Iker Muniain, and in typical Basque tradition, they are going to play in the knockout matches in Europe with &amp;lsquo;Euskadi&amp;rsquo; proudly written in front of their shirts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have continued to watch and follow the beautiful game, save for my first few months in Bangalore. This is supposed to be a metro. Well, apparently a metro where people don&amp;rsquo;t give a damn about football. After taking a cable connection, I soon realized that I will have to beg with the cable guy to put on ESPNStar so that I could watch EPL. Pretty soon, Hathway had some issues with ESPNStar, which meant there was no way I could watch ESPNStar. On the weekends, I tried to pursue the cable operator to put on NEO Sports, at least I could watch Bundes Liga and Serie A. He would not budge, and I had to endure the interesting argument that &amp;ldquo;NEO Cricket and NEO Sports are the same&amp;rdquo;. It was tough to accept - in the small village of Vadakkethala, where I hail from, I could watch as much football as I wanted. In Malappuram, if you are a cable TV operator and don&amp;rsquo;t put on channels with football on, God save you. So Bangalore&amp;rsquo;s apparent indifference to football was frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I really liked ZenTest&amp;rsquo;s Autospec in action. Recently, when I was trying to write some Python stuff, I thought it would be nice if I would have a tool that would just run the unit tests, so that I don&amp;rsquo;t have to switch between console windows. Better still, I could run it from inside my Emacs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Clearly, monitoring files for changes, shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be big deal. I decided to write the tool myself in Python. the prime intension was to help myself learn Python. Although that didn&amp;rsquo;t quite workout, I managed to come up with a quick and dirty hack to do it. It uses &lt;code&gt;pyinotify&lt;/code&gt;, which is a Python module for monitoring filesystem changes. Since &lt;code&gt;pyinotify&lt;/code&gt; depends on the Linux kernel, this would work only on Linux boxes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As I had predicted, the last week of training was hectic, chaotic and crazy. Although we ended up leaving the whole project simulation in jeopardy, we learned a lot of things, especially how things that work smoothly at one second can go wrong very very wrong the next second.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I had decided beforehand that I would volunteer for roles that I want to do in my career, and that at the same time would leave me out of my comfort zone. I played the BA role for two days, and although I made lots of mistakes, I did certain things well. I was appreciated for the e-mails I sent out that day. And I got some nice feedback from the head of training, and I am sure his words will help me in my way forward.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I am really looking forward to it, as are fellow new recruits.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Last week, we had the chance to have dinner with the chairman of the company. It was really great talking to him about all kind of things- politics, society and religion. The restaurant where we had dinner was nice, and the food was great.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I used to wonder why sometimes they did not reply to a mail I sent, or did not ping me back when I pinged them on IM. Well, now I know!

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yet another week of my Bangalore life has unfolded. It was tougher, and better than the first two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I learned lots of new stuff, stuff that would greatly help me in my profession. I made friends with new people. But most important of all, I got some feedback on some of the things I do in life. It was kind of very scary, to be honest. But then I realized that the feedback will let me improve. I am trying hard to use the feedback in the most positive way possible.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is my 13th day in Bangalore. And the first week of my training at ToughtWorks has gone by. I learned lots of stuff, talked to some great people and made friends with some of them. I still have not overcome the difficulties of adapting to life in the City. May be I will soon, or I never will.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I had planned to post everyday about my experiences in TWU. But I did not have much time. The sessions last till 5:00 pm, and then I will be very tired to do much. I am really missing football. I had hoped to play with my friend Aneesh on last Sunday, but we were not allowed to play as one old guy who turned up decided that only regulars could play there.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday was my first day in the training program at ThoughtWorks. It was lots of fun. The best part of it was learning about the values TW stands for. That, along with reading about Roy&amp;rsquo;s vision has given me a feeling of pride that I am working for a company that is part of a larger movement. Now I have to acquire the skills that would make me useful at ThoughtWorks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is going to be yet another entry in the list of posts that depicts boredom more than anything. Post college, waiting to join ThoughtWorks, I have nothing much to do. Of course, I have some study materials to go through. I am not neck deep in those materials. I have to complete them if I want to do well at ThoughtWorks.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some football would have cheered me up a bit. But there is no hope on the horizon in this regard.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I missed one of the greatest upsets in recent footbal history, because of the failed cable network.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The United States beat mighty Spain in the first semi final of the Confederations Cup. Spain was unbeaten for 35 matches prior to this and to think the US beat them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The fact that I missed it adds to compound my post-college woes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Its past mid-night and there is a football match going on, between Spain and the US and the cable network is down. Spain may be the world&amp;rsquo;s number one team, but they are not Brazil. That means the Cable TV operator can sleep peacefully, because nobody is going to call him up and ask the cable network to be repaired in the middle of the night. In my part of the world called Malappuram, it happens when the cable network has a problem while Argentina or Brazil is playing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I spent most part of yesterday reading about Edward Said and Mahmoud Darwish, the most prominent of Palestinian thinkers and poets respectively. One curious thing I noticed was that Rudyard Kipling&amp;rsquo;s 1989 novel Kim which is considered one of Kipling&amp;rsquo;s rare work on adult life had an introduction and was edited by Said.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have been reading Kim at least twice for the past nine summers. I found the book ten years ago, among the debris left by one of our seniors, when he departed the residential school we were part of. I developed an instant liking for the book. It was in ways different from what one would associate with Kipling. The adventures that the world offered to the young Kim, the way he took on those adventures and his pure unadulterated longing for freedom had the adolescent in me captivated, time again and again. I took the book home for summer vacations and as there were not much books around at home, I dived back to Kim&amp;rsquo;s world again and again. It should be somewhere inside a cupboard back home.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My Bachelor of Technology course is over. Well, almost - all that is left is for me to collect a set of signatures showing absence of any liabilities to the college. I will be leaving Trivandrum on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Am I sad that it is all over? Yes, I am. The four years spent at CET was the best time of my life. I will miss every single person that I got to meet at CET in those four years.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I love Java, and I think I will be doing a lot of stuff in Java once I start out at ThoughtWorks. They have given me some books to learn Java and Extreme Programming. Since I have six weeks between leaving college and joining ThoughtWorks, I had decided that I would do the studying once I am done with college.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One of my prime concerns when I switched to Ubuntu was how I will manage to do Java, as there is nothing like writing line of code to learn coding. So I spent most of the morning downloading and installing the Java 6 SDK from Sun. It took a lot of time (127 megabytes) if I remember right and it was a real pain waiting for the download to complete. Many of the people with whom I share the internet connection at the hostel had decided to download stuff at exactly the same time. But when the download finished, the installation took very little time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Anjali Waghmare is the wife of a policeman. Qasab asked for a Pakistani lawyer to represent him.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Taking a tour through the orkut albums of some of my friends from my school, I happened to see a photo of us in the playground, shot after a game of cricket. And there I was - thin, short and most surprisingly for me, with a cricket bat in my hand. True, I have seen the photo a number of times, I had even commented on it, but today, the bat in my hand reminding me solidly that I once used to play cricket and love it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week, we celebrated the birthday of one of my friends. There was not much of celebration per se, we just went to his place, talked a lot and had food from a restaurant. The restaurant bill was paid by the three guests, and not the host, but that is another story.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It had been a long since the four of us had come together, and so we talked about all stuff. My friend,the birthday boy, a student of nursing was apparently neck-deep in politics and was planning an agitation against the State governments decision to scrap Entrance Exams for some of the medical courses. Like every time we had a conversation back in school, our discussions turned a bit philosophical and soon we were arguing about the relevance of birthdays, anniversaries and New Years.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am about to finish my college within five months. As almost everyone at this juncture of life would have done, I am already beginning to look back at it. And nothing resurfaces from my memory like that of how it all began.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;I still remember those days after I had finished school, when I had not decided what I wanted to do. Of course, I wanted to study, but higher education did not look a feasible prospect. There were talks in the family about how costly college education was. And worse still, the discussions were being led by my father&amp;rsquo;s elder brother who was my Godfather, and easily the person whose words the family dared not to questions.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;So one day, I went up to him, and asked &amp;lsquo;So, are you going to tell me that my studies are over?’. That was the only time I had dared to stand up to him, and tell him something in his face. Never had I done that before, and never have I done that after that fateful day, and I doubt if I will ever do that again. He did not answer, and something made me ask him &amp;rsquo; so what was the point of making me rot seven of my formative years in a jail?’.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;At the time, I could not realize why I had just asked him that, but later I could see that it was my anger at realizing that I had missed a lot during the seven years I spent inside the walls of my school. But then, I had gained a lot too, but at that time, I wasn’t wise enough to realize it though. My uncle stared back at me, and I realized I was beginning to get intimidated. But I was determined not to back off.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;And then he said- &amp;rsquo; Sadique, do you realize that your family will have to make great many sacrifices to put you through college?&amp;rsquo; I nodded. He asked me another question &amp;lsquo;Are you sure you will be able to successfully complete college, and repay the family for all the sacrifices they will make for you?&amp;rsquo;. This time, I did more than just nod- I said &amp;lsquo;Yes, I am sure!’. He said, without his eyes shifting for even one second &amp;lsquo;Then, Sadique, you will go to college!&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Barclays Premier League is halfway through, and it has been one hell of a ride. Upsets, declines of perennial strong teams, rise of the challengers and amazing newcomers, EPL had it all.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this piece, I am attempting to write down some stuff that truly symbolizes the half-season gone by.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The surprise package - Hull City FC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;A lot has been said and written about the Yorkshire club who made their first ever appearance in the English top division. With gutsy displays and a game style that seems to have been borrowed from Bolton Wanderers, Hull were inside the Champions League positions for six weeks. Although they had to climb down th table owing to a drop in form, Phil Brown&amp;rsquo;s team deserve the title of the leagues surprise package. The victory against Arsenal at the Emirates stadium is their season&amp;rsquo;s highlight so far.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

And change is not coming way, or I should rather say I am not going towards change, at the rate I want to.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I want to stop getting involved in silly arguments, and more than anything, I just want to be looked upon by the rest as one of them. Unfortunately for me, certain deeds I have done in my past is not helping my cause - past fight and arguments on the football field.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Modern day football has become a professional game of the highest order, where money speaks loudest, player loyalty is as rare as silverware for ManCity, and big clubs poach youngsters from clubs with smaller financial muscle, with trick or crook.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Amidst all these there still stand a club, who recruit players from their locality, born to their tribe and is even ready to forsake their top-flight status, in order to stick to their principles. Athletic Bilbao, the Spanish club, is a Basque institution that adheres to their &amp;rsquo;la cantera&amp;rsquo; policy so passionately that, no non-Basque player has played for them since 1912.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;ManUtd&amp;rsquo;s last outing in the Champions League did not yield the kind of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/premier_league/manchester_united/article5094019.ece&#34;&gt;result&lt;/a&gt; I expected to witness, as I sat and watched the match in the very early hours of Thursday morning. Apart from United&amp;rsquo;s massive share of the possession of the ball, the only few things of note came from Celtic.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First, there was &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sr2YMwAl8ak&#34;&gt;the goal from Scot McDonald&lt;/a&gt;. The Australian produced a magnificently executed lob over Ben Foster, with the the outside of his foot to open the scoring, after being put through by Garry Caldwell&amp;rsquo;s pin-point header. The football fan in me certainly enjoyed it, but not the ManUtd supporter in me. These days, even I am confused about which part of me dominate..&lt;/p&gt;</description>

He is the best player in the game&amp;rsquo;s rich history, challenged to that position only by Pele. He has won it all, including the World Cup. And now, he is risking the loss of the title of God by taking up the post of the national coach.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday was a great occasion for football in India. After a very long time, India won a genuine tournament at Asia level (there were the Nehru Cup&amp;rsquo;s, SAF Cup&amp;rsquo;s etc, but then these didn&amp;rsquo;t feature teams like DPR Korea or Tajikistan).&lt;br&gt;&#xA;India won the second edition of the AFC Challenge Cup beating Tajikistan 4-1 in the final. It was a commanding performance from India against a team, whose every touch showed the wide gulf between the technical abilities of the two sets of players.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ever since I wrote the third part of my article about the trek to Agasthyamala, I was caught up in a stream of pretty exhausting activities.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;But since passing examinations and securing a job offer are things that fall in to the category of must-do&amp;rsquo;s, activities like watching football, blogging, orkutting etc. have had to climb down the ladder of priorities in life. It was the off-season as far as football was concerned and staying away from watching football was not that tough (There was of course Euro 2008, but then, England had managed to not qualify ).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After the forest guards were convinced we didn&amp;rsquo;t carry anything illegal and we were introduced to our guide, we set out on to the trail. I was already at the front of the pack and soon my friend Manu joined me. Ans so, we began to set the pace for the group. Most of the pictures were taken by my friends in the group, and they were very slow to say they least, because they were shooting pictures on every corner of the trail. And luckily for me, the guide chose to stick with them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After the breakfast, it was time to start the real journey. We collected our bags and set out for the Forest Departments check post. The scenery of the Estate was so breath taking. Although it is a Tea estate, it has been almost a decade since any tea-making really took place here. It was shut down because of constant struggle between Tata Tea and the Trade Unions. Most of the employees made makeshift homes and settled down in the estate. The situation is really illustrated by the state of the tea-processing factory.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It was early March, the college was going forward with its usual disregard for people who were not much interested in what went on in there. My friend group decided to go for a trek, up Agasthymala, which is the second tallest peak in Kerala.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;The trip involved taking an early morning bus to the Bonaccord Tea Estate in Vidhura, a village on the slopes of the Western Ghats. From there we would go to a base station about 15 kilometers, in to the deep forest and then we would climb the peak.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last Monday, Chelsea completed their 80th unbeaten game at Stamford Bridge. The mood among the loyal Chelsea fans should have been joyous, had not their team just put on on performance that even the Derby county manager Paul Jewell would not accept from his team. Chelsea were playing Wigan , who are fighting for yet another year in the top flight of English football. There was nothing commendable about the home team&amp;rsquo;s performance apart from Joe Cole&amp;rsquo;s contribution at the beginning of the second half. Avram Grant found himself at the receiving end of a standing booing-off from the terraces.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We lost the match 3-2 , even after leading twice. I had a nightmare of a match.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It is yet another football tournament at the hostel. It means a lot of things to me. The most important thing is I madly love football. Secondly this is that time of the year when I tend to make lot of enemies, by reacting to trash-talk.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My team has been perennial under achievers as far as football is concerned at the hostel. We play well but have never won anything. The journey usually ends with disappointing defeats in the semi-final and final.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Playing football at Kovalam</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We happened to go through old photos and this one brought back memories of a trip down to the Kovalam beach. There is the sun, the sand and the sea and yet I felt more relaxed and happy kicking a football around.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://sadique.io/images/kovalam.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Kovalam&#34; title=&#34;Kovalam&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It also brings back memories of a ManUtd shirt that my boyhood friend Safeer gave me. It was his dearest possession and yet he was ready to part ways with it to make the ManUtd fan in me happy. Now that&amp;rsquo;s one true friend.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>It is a cruel game for sure</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It has been said again and again about the beautiful game of football, but never before in my life as a football fan have I seen those words materializing before my eyes like Derby&amp;rsquo;s recent performances.&#xA;The newly promoted &amp;ldquo;Rams&amp;rdquo; had a bad start to their season, nobody even thought they would stay up at the end of the season and manager Billy Davies was sacked in November. Pride Park welcomed Paul Jewell - a manager who had helped bottom sides survive twice in the past. And pride, that was so far absent in Derby&amp;rsquo;s game came back with a bang.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been pondering on writing a blog for so long and I was confused on what to write .&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At last I have decided what I want to write about- the topic that I know most about and nobody else knows much about- yes, I have decided to write about me and the world as I look at it .&lt;br&gt;&#xA;I cannot assure you that my blog will win your heart or it will be pleasing to read but I can assure you one thing- every single word that would be written will come straight from my heart.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
