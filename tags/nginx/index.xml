      <description>&lt;p&gt;From 2014 to 2023, I kept track of all our finances, in one way or another. I started out with Intuit&amp;rsquo;s Mint - it did a good job of aggregating accounts and presenting consolidated views. At some point, I became weary of Intuit having passwords to all my financial accounts and decided to keep track of everything in a Google Sheet, fronted by a Google Form to enter data.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently I spent some time debugging an issue our team was facing around some C# code making a request on one of our servers. The request was throwing a &lt;code&gt;The server committed a protocol violation. Section=ResponseStatusLine&lt;/code&gt; error.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Initial investigation suggested that this could happen if we are making HTTP/1.1 requests to a server configured for HTTP/1.0. Our Rails application runs on Mongrel fronted with nginx 0.6.5. We modified the C# code to use HTTP/1.0 and the error went away. The following line does the trick.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
