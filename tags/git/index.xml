      <title>Emacs hack: Viewing Git logs while composing commit messages</title>

      <description>I use Emacs as my editor to compose Git commit messages. I almost never commit from the terminal with git commit -m. This approach has two advantages: I get a chance to verify what is being committed and get to compose the message using a proper editor complete with spell checking provided by flyspell mode. One thing I wish I had access to while composing commit messages is the git log.</description>

      <description>TL;DR - Use the core.commentchar configuration to change the character Git uses to mark comment lines in commit messages.&#xA;My team has a convention of putting the number of the current Issue/Ticket/Story that we are working on at the beginning of every commit message. This is great because it lets us make sense of the history of our code by helping us answer&#xA;What were the changes made to the code base to build a feature or fix an issue?</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In a project that I was a part of in the recent past, we used Story Branching. While it afforded us flexibility in pulling and pushing stories in and out of releases, it has given us some scares in the past. Somebody makes commits against a story, but the commit does not get merged to the correct release branch where it is supposed to go or gets merged to another release. The solution was to hunt down the commits that are missing or have creeped in.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is where the &lt;a href=&#34;http://linux.die.net/man/1/git-cherry&#34;&gt;git cherry&lt;/a&gt; command is useful. Git cherry finds commits not merged from a branch to another. From the man page:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Every commit that doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist in the upstream branch has its id (sha1) reported, prefixed by a symbol. The ones that have equivalent change already in the upstream branch are prefixed with a minus (-) sign, and those that only exist in the head branch are prefixed with a plus (+) symbol&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>
