      <description>I have been writing a fun Android App. Share With Title is a small application that allows you to share web pages you are reading to other applications without having to jump through the messy copy-paste hoop. (You should try it. If you share stuff from the web like I do, it will save you a lot of time and frustration). I have been coding on Android Studio, Google&amp;rsquo;s IntelliJ based IDE for Android development.</description>

      <description>Continuing from the last blog post, I have been looking at reading user input from a Gradle script. This was a result of Stack Overflow user user672009&amp;rsquo;s question about prompting for input from a Gradle script so the one does not have to include passwords in the script while checking in.&#xA;Just like the last example, the fact that Gradle scripts are written in a Groovy DSL comes to our help.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;OpenSignal released the July 2013 edition &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; of their State of Android report. Among many things like the dominance of Samsung, HTC&amp;rsquo;s faltering performance and Motorola&amp;rsquo;s struggle, it points out that the Android device landscape is more fragmented than ever. Out of &lt;em&gt;682000&lt;/em&gt; devices surveyed for the report, &lt;em&gt;11868&lt;/em&gt; distinct devices were seen. This has met with cries of anguish from Developers and the usual suspects &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is a very important point in the OpenSignal report that gets ignored or does not get as much focus as it deserves. To quote:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For consumers, extreme fragmentation means that they can get exactly the phone they want – big or small, cheap or expensive, with any number of different feature combinations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>
