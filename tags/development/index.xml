      <title>Understanding trailing @ processing in SAS input</title>
      <link>https://sadique.io/blog/2019/03/23/understanding-trailing-@-processing-in-sas-input/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the first things I noticed when I started poking around in SAS code is that the &lt;code&gt;input&lt;/code&gt; statement is very powerful, flexible and hence sometimes hard to understand. It can read pretty much anything in to a dataset as long as you tell it what to do.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The use of trailing &lt;code&gt;@&lt;/code&gt;s to take control of how SAS advances the input pointer is a powerful technique to read from input files where the data is laid out in non-standard formats. In this blog post, we will try to understand how trailing &lt;code&gt;@&lt;/code&gt; processing works with the help of some &lt;code&gt;infile&lt;/code&gt; statement options and the &lt;code&gt;putlog&lt;/code&gt; statement to write to the SAS log.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Importing the SASUSER datasets in SAS Studio</title>
      <link>https://sadique.io/blog/2019/03/23/importing-the-sasuser-datasets-in-sas-studio/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been playing around with SAS for the last two weeks. I started with a SAS University Edition running on a VirtualBox instance on my MacBook, but soon realized that it was way more convenient to use a SAS OnDemand account. Having made the switch, I realized that all learning materials made references to and used examples with datsets from a library named &lt;code&gt;SASUSER&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It was not clear how to get these datasets and use them in SAS Studio. After a bunch of searches, I found &lt;a href=&#34;https://communities.sas.com/t5/SAS-Certification/How-to-get-SASUSER-library-s-data-sets/m-p/306631/highlight/true#M124&#34;&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt; that pointed at data set up scripts for these datasets. The URL it pointed to had of course been repurposed and now redirected to a marketing page. After going back through multiple versions of the page on Internet Archive, I finally managed to find a &lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20151005165134/http://support.sas.com:80/publishing/cert/basecertguide3.html&#34;&gt;snapshot&lt;/a&gt; that linked to a set up file that worked.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Handling Deserialization errors in Spring Redis Sessions</title>
      <link>https://sadique.io/blog/2016/11/02/handling-deserialization-errors-in-spring-redis-sessions/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the challenges of using storing spring sessions in Redis is that the objects that gets stored as part of a session often undergoes changes as the application evolves and these changes cause de-serialization exceptions to be thrown after a deployment when a session created before the deployment is presented to the application. This blog post discusses a method to work around this issue.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Both Spring Security and Angular JS provide support for CSRF protection. However, getting these to work together to provide protection from CSRF requires some non-obvious configuration. This blog post explains how to add CSRF protection to an application that uses Spring Security with an Angular JS front end.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Controlling Redis auto-configuration for Spring Boot Session</title>
      <link>https://sadique.io/blog/2016/07/16/controlling-redis-auto-configuration-for-spring-boot-session/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 16 Jul 2016 22:42:05 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://sadique.io/blog/2016/07/16/controlling-redis-auto-configuration-for-spring-boot-session/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you have been using Spring Boot, chances are that you are using the Spring Session library to handle sessions. Spring Session has the ability to persist the sessions to various data stores, including Redis. The default behaviors of Spring Boot when combined with Spring Session is to start using Redis as the session store the moment &lt;code&gt;spring-session-data-redis&lt;/code&gt; is detected in the class path, thereby making it hard to conditionally turn Redis support ON and OFF. This blog post explores why this is the default behavior and presents a solution to control this behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In parts 1 through 4 of this series, we built a Spring API that can issue a JWT when a user successfully authenticates and verify the JWT presented by the client for subsequent requests. In this blog post - the last in the series, we will build a simple Angular JS application with authentication that uses this API as the backend.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;meta content=&#34;logstash spring boot example&#34; name=&#34;keywords&#34;&gt;&#xA;If you have an application that writes logs, there are many reasons to make it write the log in JSON format. It makes it easier to search and analyze them when using tools such as the ELK Stack [^1]. JSON formatted logs make it easier to look at them when looking at how the app is behaving in real time using tools like jq [^2]. This blog post documents how to format logs as JSON in a Spring application.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is one of those blog posts about things I wish I had known before I spent a lot of time figuring out when something was not working as expected. Recently, we have been trying to extend a &lt;code&gt;WebMvcConfigurerAdapter&lt;/code&gt; to wire up an HTTP request interceptor. And things did not work as we expected it to and we learned that our understanding of how Spring behaved under this situation was wrong. This is a write up to refer back to if and when we encounter this issue again.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday my colleague &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/imdhmd&#34;&gt;Imdad&lt;/a&gt; asked if there was a mechanism to add filtering to a Spring MVC end point that responded with JSON. We both started looking at it and this blog post explores a way to do it, albeit for a specific type of responses that was relevant to our discussions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently at work, we had to deprecate a domain event. This event used to represent an error scenario. However, the business had since decided that this is no longer a valid error scenario. Removing the Java class is not straight forward - since there are events of this type stored in the event store, every time the aggregate associated with this event is loaded, Axon will throw errors trying to de-serialize them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This time, we will take a look at how to achieve the same without having to depend on an exception.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Spring&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code&gt;CommandLineRunner&lt;/code&gt; provides a great mechanism to build command line applications. While this convenience is great, applications that use &lt;code&gt;CommandLineRunner&lt;/code&gt; require extra effort in some areas like integration testing. Exit codes are such an area - applications that use command line runners always report their exit code as &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; even if there are exceptions thrown. This blog post explains a way to get to programmable exit codes for such applications.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;meta content=&#34;spring, arguments, handlermethodargumentresolver, spring mvc, spring boot&#34; name=&#34;keywords&#34;&gt;&#xA;Most of the Spring controllers in the real world accept a lot of different types of parameters - Path variables, URL parameters, request headers, request body and sometimes even the entire HTTP Request object. This provides a flexible mechanism to create APIs. Spring is really good at parsing these parameters in to Java types as long as there is an ObjectMapper (like Jackson) configured to take care of the de-serialization.&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, there are situations where you want methods to receive a parameter of a particular type that has to resolved from a set of parameters–for example, an API can expect consumers to send meta data about a request in the form of headers and need a custom type to hold this information. Spring provides a convenient way to provide such custom arguments. This blog post explores this feature and how to implement it and test it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My team at work has been lately working on a data transformer that pushes information from an external system in to platform. For historical reasons the information is passed to us in the form of flat files. We have been working on a data transformer that reads information from the file and posts it into an HTTP end point.&#xA;Apache Camel &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; makes a natural choice as the base for implementing such a data transformer. The presence of ready to use components that can read files and post information to HTTP end points and the availability of a nice D.S.L. &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; makes implementation easy and straightforward. One of the things we had to spend time figuring out was how to ensure that we authenticate correctly against our target HTTP end point. This blog post takes a look at various methods we explored.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Thoughts on Open Graph tags</title>

      <guid>https://sadique.io/blog/2015/12/15/thoughts-on-open-graph-tags/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Open Graph protocol was designed by Facebook to help content creators generate a richer preview of links to their content when they get posted in to Facebook. It was originally proposed as a simple mark up that can be adopted in platforms beyond Facebook. The Open Graph Protocol Design Decisions presentation &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; does a very good job of enumerating the motivation and design decisions made for Open Graph. I have lately been reading and experimenting with these tags and I notice a fair bit of differences when it comes to how these tags are used by different platforms.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href=&#34;https://sadique.io/blog/2015/12/10/integration-testing-challenges-for-non-web-spring-applications/&#34;&gt;last blog post&lt;/a&gt;, I wrote about the challenges of writing an integration test for a Spring command line application. One of the solutions for this issue discussed in the blog post was to use the &lt;code&gt;@IntegrationTest&lt;/code&gt; annotations to inject Java system properties and use that to run the application instead of the normal command line arguments. This blog post describes how to perform this.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We are building a command line data loader application at work that uses Spring. One of the things that I took us more time that it should have to figure out was how to write an integration test that invokes the command line application with the right command line arguments. This blog post describes this scenario and a potential solution to this problem.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I first started programming, it was predominantly creating applications that utilized the C++ graphics library. I was 14 and my friends and I tried to make the most of the time we got to spend at the computer lab of the boarding school we attended. We created applications that drew pretty, often animated pictures on the screen and not much else. This taught us basics, but our learning lacked any kind of structure. We read and figured out just enough to do what we wanted to do. There was no guidance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Implementing custom annotations for Spring MVC</title>

      <description>&lt;meta content=&#34;spring, annotation, custom annotation, spring mvc, spring boot&#34; name=&#34;keywords&#34;&gt;&#xA;I often have to work with Spring MVC based code bases that have been living for a while. One of the common trait of these code bases I have observed is the repeated use of the same Spring annotations to achieve the same effect again and again. A really good example of this is annotating a controller method with a combination of `@RequestMapping` and `@ResponseStatus` to set the expected request and response `Content-Type`, the request Method, response status etc. This blog post describes how to create custom Spring annotationshow to create custom annotation in spring mvc that produce the same effect as multiple Spring annotations acting together.</description>

      <description>&lt;meta content=&#34;spring, validate, request, parameters, @requestparam, spring mvc, param, validation&#34; name=&#34;keywords&#34;&gt;&#xA;Spring MVC provides a convenient way to validate inputs to API end points through the use of `JSR-303` annotations. While this mechanism works great for end points that consume a `RequestBody` (as is the case with most `POST` and `PUT` requests), it is not easy to achieve the same effect for end points that consume primitives in the form of path variables or request parameters (as is the case with most `GET` requests).</description>

      <guid>https://sadique.io/blog/2015/11/24/testing-async-responses-using-mockmvc/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are times when a Spring MVC end point performs asynchronous operations. Testing these end points using MockMvc can be tricky because of the asynchronous nature in which the result of the operation is eventually returned. This blog post describes how to write tests in such scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This blog post describes how to set up Tomcat to run multiple applications running as separate JVM processes, using the same Tomcat installation. This method utilizes the &lt;code&gt;CATALINA_HOME&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;CATALINA_BASE&lt;/code&gt; environment variables used by Tomcat. I have verified this method against Tomcat versions &lt;code&gt;8.0.x&lt;/code&gt;; other versions should work the same way.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Cloud Foundry allows fine grained declaration of security groups, down to IP address ranges and Ports. While this provides great flexibility, making sense of why each rule in a security group exists and what each does is really difficult because of the limitations of the security group declaration mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I have been trying out Cloud Foundry. Today while trying to set up monitoring through AppDynamics, the sample application that I was using started crashing because of a Java memory error. This blog post discusses how to prevent this from happening by configuring Java memory parameters used by the application.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been playing around with Clojure and after familiarising myself with the core, I decided to start writing little programs that forces me to choose the right idioms. I am starting off with Levenshtein edit distance of two strings.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;levenshtein-edit-distance&#34;&gt;Levenshtein edit distance&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Levenshtein edit distance between two string is a way of quantifying how similar or dissimilar they are, lower distance implying higher similarity. The algorithm to calculate Levenshtein distance is fairly simple - the algorithm cares about three operations that can be performed at a particular position in a string to move it towards the other - insertion, deletion and substitution.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;meta content=&#34;jmeter, login&#34; name=&#34;keywords&#34;&gt;&#xA;I had to set up a JMeter test last week - the test included logging in to a site, and then hitting a bunch of URLs, all of them being GET requests. I found it hard to find a simple documentation that described how to do this - the ones I found were either incomplete or were trying to teach me a large number of things at the same time. So when I figured it out, I decided to write this down, for anyone else finding themselves in the same place as me.&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For this example, the application under test is a simple Rails application, with the login form at &lt;code&gt;/login&lt;/code&gt; and a &lt;code&gt;POST&lt;/code&gt; request to &lt;code&gt;/login&lt;/code&gt; does the authentication.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

However, as pointed out in the improvements section, the implementation was not complete - it did not provide clients enough information about the rate limiting that is in place and how long they should wait before making further requests once they hit the limit.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Rate limiting is often put in place to prevent the hogging of resources by a sub set of the users of the system. Rate limiting works by responding with error messages when a client exceeds their allocated share of requests within a predefined time window. In addition to the error message, the response should also include information as to when rate limit will be reset so that the client can continue accessing the system after the reset.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Python Hack - Dynamically override an object&#39;s attribute</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;While working with Locust &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; recently, we ran into a situation where we had to dynamically override an attribute in a class in the Locust library so as to control what value it got assigned. After a lot of scratching our heads and reading the Python documentation, we came across the &lt;code&gt;property&lt;/code&gt; function. We were able to use this to hack together a solution that ensures that every time an attribute is read, it returns the result of executing a method.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Managing Gemsets in Rbenv</title>
      <link>https://sadique.io/blog/2013/09/12/managing-gemsets-in-rbenv/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 12 Sep 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://sadique.io/blog/2013/09/12/managing-gemsets-in-rbenv/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I was setting up my new laptop today, I decided to use Rbenv &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; to manage my Ruby versions. I have typically used RVM &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and had never used Rbenv. Rbenv is a Ruby version manager written by &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sstephenson/&#34;&gt;Sam Stephenson&lt;/a&gt; and deliberately tries to do less and do it well. Instead of overriding Bash commands like RVM does, Rbenv chooses to use wrappers or &lt;strong&gt;shims&lt;/strong&gt; around Ruby binaries to choose the Ruby executable to run.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This works well, until you have to manage Gemsets &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Often, one is working on two projects that use the same version of Ruby, but has entirely different chain of dependency on Gems. RVM&amp;rsquo;s gemsets work really well for this use case. I was looking around to see how one would manage gemsets with Rbenv. There are three ways to do it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/kgrz&#34;&gt;Kashyap&lt;/a&gt; asked how one can identify the compiler parameters passed when compiling a Ruby version. I was curious how to achieve this and like any confused developer started searching for and looking in the Ruby documentation. Searching for &lt;strong&gt;compiler parameters in ruby&lt;/strong&gt; did not yield any interesting results and the group of constants with the &lt;code&gt;RUBY_&lt;/code&gt; prefix &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; loaded in Ruby did not include anything related to compiler flags. Then I came across this blog post &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; by &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/happycode&#34;&gt;Jan Lelis&lt;/a&gt; and I was curious what else &lt;code&gt;RbConfig::CONFIG&lt;/code&gt; contains. This hash contains all the compiler flags used to compile the current Ruby VM.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Python does not have a true boolean type. The &lt;code&gt;True&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;False&lt;/code&gt; built-in values in Python are wrappers around the integers &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;. This results in some interesting results involving True and False.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#586e75;background-color:#eee8d5;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34; data-lang=&#34;python&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#859900;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;True&lt;/span&gt; == &lt;span style=&#34;color:#2aa198;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#859900;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#859900;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;False&lt;/span&gt; == &lt;span style=&#34;color:#2aa198;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#859900;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#859900;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;True&lt;/span&gt; + &lt;span style=&#34;color:#2aa198;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#2aa198;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#859900;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;False&lt;/span&gt; - &lt;span style=&#34;color:#2aa198;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;-&lt;span style=&#34;color:#2aa198;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#cb4b16&#34;&gt;str&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#859900;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;)&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#2aa198&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;True&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#cb4b16&#34;&gt;repr&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#859900;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;)&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#2aa198&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;True&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Python bool implementation got formalised in PEP 285 &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; in 2002 by Guido van Rossum. The specification gives a lot of insight into von Rossum&amp;rsquo;s insistence on maintaining backward compatibility and the Python way. It also touches up on another aspect of truthness in Python. In Python, almost all objects can be used to represent truth values. This means an empty list is false and a non-empty list is true.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Emacs hack: Viewing Git logs while composing commit messages</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I use Emacs as my editor to compose Git commit messages. I almost never commit from the terminal with &lt;code&gt;git commit -m&lt;/code&gt;. This approach has two advantages: I get a chance to verify what is being committed and get to compose the message using a proper editor complete with spell checking provided by &lt;em&gt;flyspell mode&lt;/em&gt;. One thing I wish I had access to while composing commit messages is the git log. This is useful to refer to work items and encourages one to use a consistent style in the messages. This was easier in the terminal as one could do something like &lt;code&gt;git log -n 3&lt;/code&gt; and then commit with the &lt;code&gt;-m&lt;/code&gt; flag.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;TL;DR -&#xA;Use the &lt;code&gt;core.commentchar&lt;/code&gt; configuration to change the character Git uses to mark comment lines in commit messages.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My team has a convention of putting the number of the current Issue/Ticket/Story that we are working on at the beginning of every commit message. This is great because it lets us make sense of the history of our code by helping us answer&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;What were the changes made to the code base to build a feature or fix an issue?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Given a changeset, why was it put in place?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We use the format &lt;code&gt;#123 Foo bar&lt;/code&gt; for the message where &lt;code&gt;123&lt;/code&gt; is the issue number because it lets &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thoughtworks-studios.com/mingle&#34;&gt;Mingle&lt;/a&gt;, our project management tool track the commits made against each card.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>My experience working remotely</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There has been a lot of debate in the tech community about working remotely and the willingness of employers to allow this option to their employees. At the very beginning of my career as a programmer, I had the opportunity to work on a distributed team. While the team was distributed, I was still working from an office and for almost half of the duration of my work on the team I had team members sitting beside me in the same office. Because of this, my scenario may not be representative of the population of programmers who work remotely. However, there are a number of things I learned from the experience that I would like to share.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Oh, is this what you guys have been building for three years? I can build it in a month!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Substitute the two time durations with something appropriate and you end up with how some software developers react after encountering a new project or application. I have seen this happen in multiple situations, where I had more context of how the application in question had evolved which the person making the comment did not have.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>JavaScript, clipboard access and hidden flash widgets</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Letting users copy text and URLs from a webpage effortlessly is one of those things that sound easy in theory, but is a pain when it comes to implementation. Browsers take great efforts to ensure that web pages are sand boxed in such a way that a web application can not read from or write to the system&amp;rsquo;s clipboard without jumping through hoops. Firefox asks you to change browser configurations to give web applications access to the system clipboard, while Internet Explorer shows a modal dialog to confirm that you really want to allow the application access. This diminishes any user experience gains made by implementing this feature in the first place. Brook Novak has a very good article about JavaScript and the clipboard &lt;a href=&#34;http://brooknovak.wordpress.com/2009/07/28/accessing-the-system-clipboard-with-javascript/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I use Emacs as my primary text editor and I use it to edit&#xA;commit messages for Git. I almost never use the &lt;code&gt;-m&lt;/code&gt;&#xA;option with &lt;code&gt;git commit&lt;/code&gt;. Since I have a fairly customised Emacs&#xA;configuration based around Sam Aaron&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/overtone/emacs-live&#34;&gt;Emacs Live&lt;/a&gt;, this means that&#xA;for every commit, there is a visible delay for Emacs to start up for the&#xA;commit message. I was looking for ways to reduce this and figured out that&#xA;running Emacs in &lt;code&gt;daemon&lt;/code&gt; mode and using &lt;code&gt;emacsclient&lt;/code&gt; as the&#xA;&lt;code&gt;GIT_EDITOR&lt;/code&gt; would solve this.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>My first Firefox plugin: GetCache - View cached version of the current page</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I released my &lt;a href=&#34;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/getcache-ff/&#34;&gt;first Firefox plugin&lt;/a&gt; today. It&#xA;is awaiting review, but if you are adventurous, you can install it right&#xA;now. Go on, try it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After I had written the &lt;a href=&#34;https://sadique.io/blog/2012/11/28/getcache-a-chrome-plugin-to-view-cached-version-of-the-current-page/&#34;&gt;Chrome version&lt;/a&gt; yesterday, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/ManishChaks&#34;&gt;Manish&lt;/a&gt; suggested&#xA;that I should write one for Firefox. There already exist Firfox plugins&#xA;that does exactly what GetCache does, but I decided to go ahead and write it&#xA;for fun. And of course, the fact that I could publish it without having&#xA;to sign up with my Credit Card information was enticing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Download the plugin&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://sadique.io/downloads/GetCache.crx&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On numerous occasions, I have ran in to the situation where I had to&#xA;look up how to load Google&amp;rsquo;s cached version of a particular page. This&#xA;happens often when I follow a link from Hacker News or Reddit to a blog&#xA;post and the blog has went down due to the great avalanche of traffic&#xA;from HN and Reddit.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After struggling to remember and having to Google how to get the cached&#xA;version, I decided to finally solve this issue. I wrote &lt;code&gt;GetCache&lt;/code&gt;, a&#xA;dead simple Google Chrome plugin that loads Google&amp;rsquo;s cached version of&#xA;the current page.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;installing&#34;&gt;Installing&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can download the plugin&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://sadique.io/downloads/GetCache.crx&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. In order to install it, open your&#xA;Extensions page (&lt;code&gt;Window -&amp;gt; Extensions&lt;/code&gt;) and drag the downloaded &lt;code&gt;CRX&lt;/code&gt;&#xA;file to the page.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>On REST, Content-Type, Google Chrome and Caching</title>
      <link>https://sadique.io/blog/2012/11/27/on-rest-content-type-google-chrome-and-caching/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Representational State Transfer (REST) is a style of software&#xA;architecture for distributed systems that has replaced technologies like&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP&#34;&gt;SOAP&lt;/a&gt; as the predominant Web service&#xA;design model. Originally proposed by Roy Fielding in his &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm&#34;&gt;Doctorate&#xA;dissertation&lt;/a&gt;,&#xA;REST puts a lot of emphasis on resources, their representations and states. Basically a URL indicates a&#xA;single resource; the HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) indicates what&#xA;action should be performed on that resource; and the ACCEPT header indicates the format that the resource should be presented in.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;chrome-and-content-type&#34;&gt;Chrome and Content-Type&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Having seen this, one would assume that if you have a resource, say a&#xA;&lt;code&gt;User&lt;/code&gt; on your system and there were two representations of that&#xA;resource - HTML and JSON. Let&amp;rsquo;s assume that the HTML representation does&#xA;an AJAX call to fetch the JSON representation and renders it. While this&#xA;sounds simple enough, Google Chrome, one of the world&amp;rsquo;s most popular&#xA;browsers&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=108766&#34;&gt;totally breaks this&lt;/a&gt;. A&#xA;good example of this weird behaviour can be seen &lt;a href=&#34;http://chrome-json-bug.heroku.com/docs&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Understanding Python&#39;s &#34;with&#34; statement</title>
      <link>https://sadique.io/blog/2012/07/09/understanding-pythons-with-statement/</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-it&#34;&gt;What is it?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Python&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code&gt;with&lt;/code&gt; statement provides a very convenient way of dealing with the situation where you have to do a setup and teardown to make something happen. A very good example for this is the situation where you want to gain a handler to a file, read data from the file and the close the file handler.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Without the &lt;code&gt;with&lt;/code&gt; statement, one would write something along the lines of:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#586e75;background-color:#eee8d5;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34; data-lang=&#34;python&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#268bd2&#34;&gt;file&lt;/span&gt; = &lt;span style=&#34;color:#cb4b16&#34;&gt;open&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#2aa198&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;/tmp/foo.txt&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;)&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#268bd2&#34;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt; = &lt;span style=&#34;color:#268bd2&#34;&gt;file&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span style=&#34;color:#268bd2&#34;&gt;read&lt;/span&gt;()&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#268bd2&#34;&gt;file&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span style=&#34;color:#268bd2&#34;&gt;close&lt;/span&gt;()&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are two annoying things here. First, you end up forgetting to close the file handler. The second is how to handle exceptions that may occur once the file handler has been obtained. One could write something like this to get around this:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#586e75;background-color:#eee8d5;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34; data-lang=&#34;python&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#268bd2&#34;&gt;file&lt;/span&gt; = &lt;span style=&#34;color:#cb4b16&#34;&gt;open&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#2aa198&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;/tmp/foo.txt&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;)&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#859900&#34;&gt;try&lt;/span&gt;:&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;    &lt;span style=&#34;color:#268bd2&#34;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt; = &lt;span style=&#34;color:#268bd2&#34;&gt;file&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span style=&#34;color:#268bd2&#34;&gt;read&lt;/span&gt;()&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#859900&#34;&gt;finally&lt;/span&gt;:&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;    &lt;span style=&#34;color:#268bd2&#34;&gt;file&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span style=&#34;color:#268bd2&#34;&gt;close&lt;/span&gt;()&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;While this works well, it is unnecessarily verbose. This is where &lt;code&gt;with&lt;/code&gt; is useful. The good thing about &lt;code&gt;with&lt;/code&gt; apart from the better syntax is that it is very good handling exceptions. The above code would look like this, when using &lt;code&gt;with&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#586e75;background-color:#eee8d5;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34; data-lang=&#34;python&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#859900&#34;&gt;with&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#cb4b16&#34;&gt;open&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#2aa198&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;/tmp/foo.txt&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;) &lt;span style=&#34;color:#859900&#34;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#268bd2&#34;&gt;file&lt;/span&gt;:&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;   &lt;span style=&#34;color:#268bd2&#34;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt; = &lt;span style=&#34;color:#268bd2&#34;&gt;file&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span style=&#34;color:#268bd2&#34;&gt;read&lt;/span&gt;()&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been doing some coding in Python recently. While playing around with some code, I noticed that the way &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Here_document&#34;&gt;heredocs&lt;/a&gt; are used in Python is different from Ruby.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;python&#34;&gt;Python&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Consider the following snippet:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#586e75;background-color:#eee8d5;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34; data-lang=&#34;python&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#93a1a1;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;# test.py&lt;/span&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#cb4b16&#34;&gt;print&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#2aa198&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;some text in single line&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#cb4b16&#34;&gt;print&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#2aa198&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&amp;#34;&amp;#34;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#2aa198&#34;&gt;As opposed to&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#2aa198&#34;&gt;some text&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#2aa198&#34;&gt;written as&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#2aa198&#34;&gt;heredoc&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#2aa198&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&amp;#34;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#cb4b16&#34;&gt;print&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#2aa198&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;and then another single line&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When run, this would result in this:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#586e75;background-color:#eee8d5;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;bash-3.2$ python test.py&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;some text in single line&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;As opposed to&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;some text&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;written as&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;heredoc&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;and &lt;span style=&#34;color:#859900&#34;&gt;then&lt;/span&gt; another single line&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notice how there is a preceding and trailing linebreak around the string printed using heredoc.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Micro Journal - simple Git-backed journal in Python</title>

      <guid>https://sadique.io/blog/2012/06/25/micro-journal-simple-git-backed-journal-in-python/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today, I pushed out &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sdqali/microjournal&#34;&gt;Microjournal&lt;/a&gt;, a simple and lightweight journal. I wrote Microjournal to reduce the pain of typing a number of commands to create and maintain my daily journal which I type out in Emacs and use Git to store. It is a single file Python script.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Microjournal does not do much on it&amp;rsquo;s own. It creates a Git repository for you, and then you can write down entries whenever you feel like. It opens the entry for the day in your $EDITOR. It adds the current date and time to the entry so that you don&amp;rsquo;t have to manually enter it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/craftybones&#34;&gt;Srijayanth Sridhar&lt;/a&gt; and I did a talk yesterday at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thoughtworks.com/events/the-testing-spirit&#34;&gt;vodQA NCR&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The talk was about what makes maintenance of large test suites a pain and the&#xA;things that have worked for us and we have seen work for other teams.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It went well and we got a lot of good feedback from the crowd. The prezi for the talk is below:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;prezi-player&#34;&gt;&lt;style type=&#34;text/css&#34; media=&#34;screen&#34;&gt;.prezi-player { width: 550px; } .prezi-player-links { text-align: center; }&lt;/style&gt;&lt;object id=&#34;prezi_igcdltanud6-&#34; name=&#34;prezi_igcdltanud6-&#34; classid=&#34;clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000&#34; width=&#34;550&#34; height=&#34;400&#34;&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;movie&#34; value=&#34;http://prezi.com/bin/preziloader.swf&#34;/&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;allowfullscreen&#34; value=&#34;true&#34;/&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;allowFullScreenInteractive&#34; value=&#34;true&#34;/&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;allowscriptaccess&#34; value=&#34;always&#34;/&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;bgcolor&#34; value=&#34;#ffffff&#34;/&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;flashvars&#34; value=&#34;prezi_id=igcdltanud6-&amp;amp;lock_to_path=0&amp;amp;color=ffffff&amp;amp;autoplay=no&amp;amp;autohide_ctrls=0&#34;/&gt;&lt;embed id=&#34;preziEmbed_igcdltanud6-&#34; name=&#34;preziEmbed_igcdltanud6-&#34; src=&#34;http://prezi.com/bin/preziloader.swf&#34; type=&#34;application/x-shockwave-flash&#34; allowfullscreen=&#34;true&#34; allowFullScreenInteractive=&#34;true&#34; allowscriptaccess=&#34;always&#34; width=&#34;550&#34; height=&#34;400&#34; bgcolor=&#34;#ffffff&#34; flashvars=&#34;prezi_id=igcdltanud6-&amp;amp;lock_to_path=0&amp;amp;color=ffffff&amp;amp;autoplay=no&amp;amp;autohide_ctrls=0&#34;&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;prezi-player-links&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&#34;Maintaining Large Test Suites&#34; href=&#34;http://prezi.com/igcdltanud6-/maintaining-large-test-suites/&#34;&gt;Maintaining Large Test Suites&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&#34;http://prezi.com&#34;&gt;Prezi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Imagine this - Your build is taking forever. You put in a lot of effort and restructure it. Things improve a lot, but it is far from where you would like it to be. You try hard to identify things that could improve the build time, but fail. You blame the platforms you use, you blame Ruby and you even blame the relative position of the Moon to Venus. Slowly you learn to accept the slow build as a part of your life. Months later a new developer joins the team and proves that there is a bug in the build scripts that causes certain tasks to be run twice.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This happened to us recently, and the subsequent debugging/postmortem revealed that there were things about our tools that we simply did not know.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Managing security certificates from the console - on Windows, Mac OS X and Linux</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For me the last two weeks or so have involved a lot of wrestling with SSL certificates. One of the things that took some time to figure out was how to piggy-back on the tools provided by different Operating Systems to manage certificates. We did not want to rewrite &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mozilla.org/projects/security/pki/nss/&#34; title=&#34;NSS&#34;&gt;NSS&lt;/a&gt;. Luckily for us, all the major OSes provide tools to manage certificates from the command line.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Indian and Pakistani cricketers - who make better debuts?</title>
      <link>https://sadique.io/blog/2012/05/11/indian-and-pakistani-cricketers-who-make-better-debuts/</link>

      <guid>https://sadique.io/blog/2012/05/11/indian-and-pakistani-cricketers-who-make-better-debuts/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently a friend and I had an argument about who makes better debuts among Indian and Pakistani cricket players. Now, I am not into cricket. But I do watch the odd matches here and there and am generally aware of what is going on in the game. My stand was that Pakistani players make better debuts compared to Indian players, while my friend was adamant that Indian players make better debuts. My friend is more of a cricket guy than I ever was and he asked me what is the basis of my stand. It was just a gut feel for me and I had to leave it as there was no way for me to prove that my gut feel was correct. But I did want to try, though.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I decided to see if I could prove my theory. Luckily, Cricinfo has all this data, although they dont make it easy for you to get it. I wrote some scripts to pull this data and decided to visualise this using the awesome d3 library. In the end, this became more about figuring out d3 than winning the argument, but doing this was fun.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Fixing Flyspell for Emacs in Mac OS X</title>
      <link>https://sadique.io/blog/2012/05/04/fixing-flyspell-for-emacs-in-mac-os-x/</link>

      <guid>https://sadique.io/blog/2012/05/04/fixing-flyspell-for-emacs-in-mac-os-x/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I use the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/FlySpell&#34;&gt;flyspell-mode&lt;/a&gt; as a spell checking mechanism in emacs. Recently, I moved to Mac OS X, and I began to get this error whenever I started emacs:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#586e75;background-color:#eee8d5;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Error enabling Flyspell mode:&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;(Searching &lt;span style=&#34;color:#859900&#34;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; program No such file or directory aspell)&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had installed aspell with Homebrew. The issue seemed to be that Emacs was unable to find the aspell binary. Homebrew installs binaries in &lt;strong&gt;/usr/local/bin&lt;/strong&gt; and it was in my $PATH. It turns out Emacs uses it&amp;rsquo;s own exec path to look for binaries to execute in sub-processes. So the fix is to add the &lt;strong&gt;/usr/local/bin&lt;/strong&gt; path to the exec-path. This is the change needed to the &lt;strong&gt;~/.emacs&lt;/strong&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Finding un-merged commits with git cherry</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In a project that I was a part of in the recent past, we used Story Branching. While it afforded us flexibility in pulling and pushing stories in and out of releases, it has given us some scares in the past. Somebody makes commits against a story, but the commit does not get merged to the correct release branch where it is supposed to go or gets merged to another release. The solution was to hunt down the commits that are missing or have creeped in.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is where the &lt;a href=&#34;http://linux.die.net/man/1/git-cherry&#34;&gt;git cherry&lt;/a&gt; command is useful. Git cherry finds commits not merged from a branch to another. From the man page:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Every commit that doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist in the upstream branch has its id (sha1) reported, prefixed by a symbol. The ones that have equivalent change already in the upstream branch are prefixed with a minus (-) sign, and those that only exist in the head branch are prefixed with a plus (+) symbol&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>

      <title>Bullet proof Jenkins setup</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this post, I will describe how a neat setup and some discipline will ensure a Jenkins that can be rolled back and recreated very easily - a bullet proof Jenkins setup.  I have been working on configuring our Jenkins instance. This was the first time I had played around with Jenkins. I am fairly comfortable with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thoughtworks-studios.com/go-agile-release-management&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Go&lt;/a&gt; from ThoughtWorks Studios. All of my past teams used Go as their tool for continuous delivery.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One of the things I found very different from Go in Jenkins is the absence of the notion of a Pipeline as the basic entity of build, as proposed in &lt;a href=&#34;http://continuousdelivery.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Continuous Delivery&lt;/a&gt;. Although there are plugins to make this available in Jenkins, we decided to go with Jenkins&amp;rsquo; model of Jobs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My new team at work is writing a bunch of Rails applications. This is one of those codebases that one would call &amp;ldquo;legacy&amp;rdquo; without much argument. Most of these apps have their own patched, vendorized Rails versions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Getting up and running was an absolute pain. This project existed before Bundler and the list of gem dependencies are not checked in. I got the output of running &lt;code&gt;gem list&lt;/code&gt; on a colleague&amp;rsquo;s box, wrote a Ruby script to generate a shell script that installs all the gems. When I tried running the tests in one of those apps, I got a nice error.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently I spent some time debugging an issue our team was facing around some C# code making a request on one of our servers. The request was throwing a &lt;code&gt;The server committed a protocol violation. Section=ResponseStatusLine&lt;/code&gt; error.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Initial investigation suggested that this could happen if we are making HTTP/1.1 requests to a server configured for HTTP/1.0. Our Rails application runs on Mongrel fronted with nginx 0.6.5. We modified the C# code to use HTTP/1.0 and the error went away. The following line does the trick.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Wikipedia Page Hopping</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have realized that like most users of Wikipedia, I do a lot of Wikipedia page-hopping [1]. Wikipedia is sort of addictive that way. You start reading about a piece of Flamenco music and after twenty minutes find yourself staring at the page about &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ETA&#34;&gt;ETA&lt;/a&gt;, a Basque nationalist organization. So I decided to figure out how I exactly do I get lost in the huge list of interconnected articles. I use Chromium, and it stores its history in a SQLite3 database file. I wrote a small Ruby script that parses the history, splits them to chunks of articles accessed per day, and filter only Wikipedia links from this.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

LOL :-)&lt;/code&gt;. I had to find what the original message was.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently my team encountered a frustrating thing while working with a Java library in JRuby. It took us long to figure out what was going wrong. This is an attempt to write down what was happening.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You are in Ruby world, a world of weak typing, no type casting and pure bliss in coding. You forget that some languages care about the type of elements in an Array. And you end up spending a lot of time figuring out why you are staring at a stupid looking exception.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I really liked ZenTest&amp;rsquo;s Autospec in action. Recently, when I was trying to write some Python stuff, I thought it would be nice if I would have a tool that would just run the unit tests, so that I don&amp;rsquo;t have to switch between console windows. Better still, I could run it from inside my Emacs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Clearly, monitoring files for changes, shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be big deal. I decided to write the tool myself in Python. the prime intension was to help myself learn Python. Although that didn&amp;rsquo;t quite workout, I managed to come up with a quick and dirty hack to do it. It uses &lt;code&gt;pyinotify&lt;/code&gt;, which is a Python module for monitoring filesystem changes. Since &lt;code&gt;pyinotify&lt;/code&gt; depends on the Linux kernel, this would work only on Linux boxes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
