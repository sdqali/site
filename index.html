              Using GitHub and Bitbucket issues for comments on Static sites

          <p>One thing that statically generated sites like this typically lack is a commenting system. There are solutions like Disqus that you can embed, but then the commenter will need to create an account there, and you now have one more dependency. Sometimes, that is a perfectly reasonable approach.</p>
<p>I came up with an approach <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> that uses GitHub issues and Bitbucket issues to host comments.
Since this site is hosted on GitHub, and most people who would leave a comment on this site have a GitHub account, it doesn&rsquo;t feel like another account to sign up for. And for those who don&rsquo;t have a GitHub account, the approach supports Bitbucket as well.</p>

          <p>From 2014 to 2023, I kept track of all our finances, in one way or another. I started out with Intuit&rsquo;s Mint - it did a good job of aggregating accounts and presenting consolidated views. At some point, I became weary of Intuit having passwords to all my financial accounts and decided to keep track of everything in a Google Sheet, fronted by a Google Form to enter data.</p>

          <p>Users of Dropwizard Metrics will be familiar with <code>ScheduledReporter</code>  - it is a nice pattern that allows metrics reporting to be off loaded to a different thread which periodically sends out the collected metrics instead of making a network call every time a metric is collected. In most use cases, this works great - especially if you are running a server.</p>

          <p>If you have built background workers or other non-server applications with Dropwizard, chances are that you used the Dropwizard Command pattern. In fact, even the sever you wrote with Dropwizard executes a command - specifically <code>io.dropwizard.cli.ServerCommand</code>. While the server command is great, sometimes you want to build applications that have all the goodies that Dropwizard offers, but you dont want to start a server. Managing Lifecycles is one example of a Dropwizard feature that works great for server applications, but needs some tweaking to get working for non-server commands.</p>

          <p>In this blog post, we will explore how Postgres stores Enum types and how to query for Enum types and their values. Postgres&rsquo; Enum, like their counterparts in many programming languags are data types that allow only a predefined set of values to be assigned to them. An interesting difference is that compared to programming languages, Postgres does allow blanks within the values of Enums.</p>

          <p>This blog post is an exercise in identifying all the <code>sequences</code> in a PostgreSQL database that is associated with a table column via an <code>OWNED BY</code> relationship. Figuring out how to do this was harder than it should have been and this journals my understanding of it.</p>

              Understanding trailing @ processing in SAS input

          <p>One of the first things I noticed when I started poking around in SAS code is that the <code>input</code> statement is very powerful, flexible and hence sometimes hard to understand. It can read pretty much anything in to a dataset as long as you tell it what to do.</p>
<p>The use of trailing <code>@</code>s to take control of how SAS advances the input pointer is a powerful technique to read from input files where the data is laid out in non-standard formats. In this blog post, we will try to understand how trailing <code>@</code> processing works with the help of some <code>infile</code> statement options and the <code>putlog</code> statement to write to the SAS log.</p>

          <p>I have been playing around with SAS for the last two weeks. I started with a SAS University Edition running on a VirtualBox instance on my MacBook, but soon realized that it was way more convenient to use a SAS OnDemand account. Having made the switch, I realized that all learning materials made references to and used examples with datsets from a library named <code>SASUSER</code>.</p>
<p>It was not clear how to get these datasets and use them in SAS Studio. After a bunch of searches, I found <a href="https://communities.sas.com/t5/SAS-Certification/How-to-get-SASUSER-library-s-data-sets/m-p/306631/highlight/true#M124">this page</a> that pointed at data set up scripts for these datasets. The URL it pointed to had of course been repurposed and now redirected to a marketing page. After going back through multiple versions of the page on Internet Archive, I finally managed to find a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151005165134/http://support.sas.com:80/publishing/cert/basecertguide3.html">snapshot</a> that linked to a set up file that worked.</p>

It was well received, as far as I could tell - I received a lot of nice feedback and had great conversations with members of the community.</p>
<p>The slides are available here on <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/sdqali/graphql-for-a-payments-api">SpeakerDeck</a>. <del>I will update this post with links to the video of my talk when it becomes available</del> The video of the talk is available <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKMDBH0CWHs">here</a>.</p>
