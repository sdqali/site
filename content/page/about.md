I am a passionate software developer.

I started my career at ThoughtWorks, building integrations and plugins for Mingle - their project management / collaboration tool. I went on to work on Twist, where we pushed the boundaries of what a functional testing tool could do.

Later, I moved to San Francisco to help migrate Mingle from an on-premise model to a SaaS offering on Amazon AWS technologies.

I spent the next 3.5 years helping ThoughtWork's partners and clients solve challenging technological problems - from Content Management Systems to E-commerce Microservices to in-store grocery picking solutions to Payment and Disbursement systems to Banking Portals, among other things.

From 2018 to 2021, I worked at Braintree in their Bank Payments team.

I currently work as a Principal Engineer at Guaranteed Rate Companies.
