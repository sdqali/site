My Bachelor of Technology course is over. Well, almost - all that is left is for me to collect a set of signatures showing absence of any liabilities to the college. I will be leaving Trivandrum on Tuesday.  

Am I sad that it is all over? Yes, I am. The four years spent at CET was the best time of my life. I will miss every single person that I got to meet at CET in those four years.
