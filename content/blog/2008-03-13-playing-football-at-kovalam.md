We happened to go through old photos and this one brought back memories of a trip down to the Kovalam beach. There is the sun, the sand and the sea and yet I felt more relaxed and happy kicking a football around.

It also brings back memories of a ManUtd shirt that my boyhood friend Safeer gave me. It was his dearest possession and yet he was ready to part ways with it to make the ManUtd fan in me happy. Now that's one true friend.
