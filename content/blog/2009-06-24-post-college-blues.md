Its past mid-night and there is a football match going on, between Spain and the US and the cable network is down. Spain may be the world's number one team, but they are not Brazil. That means the Cable TV operator can sleep peacefully, because nobody is going to call him up and ask the cable network to be repaired in the middle of the night. In my part of the world called Malappuram, it happens when the cable network has a problem while Argentina or Brazil is playing.   

The football match was my last hope on what was otherwise a very dull day.

It has been five days since I came home from college. I am terribly missing college, the hostel and my class. So that provides the tragic part. For some strange reason, youngsters in the village are playing under-arm cricket and not football in the evenings. So I am unable to play football and its so frustrating. (It might be a good thing- I wont be able to play much football once I am at Bangalore and I must get used to it!)  

Until today, I felt another kind of frustration. I badly wanted to check my mail and orkut account. The only way was to visit some internet cafe in Kottakkal. But I was too bored to do that. A good friend of mine suggested that I subscribe to a GPRS connection and he suggested a Vodafone plan. I trust him on the suggestion because he runs a Mobile Phone shop.   

The only good thing that has passed post-college is that I was able to talk with my father a lot. About ourselves, about life in Saudi Arabia, about religion, about politics and about life in general. Thank God.

I applied for my passport, and although the procedures took a whole day, it was less of a hassle than what I had heard. I ran in to an old friend after a long time. Had a nice chat with her.
