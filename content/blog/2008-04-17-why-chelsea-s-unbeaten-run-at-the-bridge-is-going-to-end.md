Last Monday, Chelsea completed their 80th unbeaten game at Stamford Bridge. The mood among the loyal Chelsea fans should have been joyous, had not their team just put on on performance that even the Derby county manager Paul Jewell would not accept from his team. Chelsea were playing Wigan , who are fighting for yet another year in the top flight of English football. There was nothing commendable about the home team's performance apart from Joe Cole's contribution at the beginning of the second half. Avram Grant found himself at the receiving end of a standing booing-off from the terraces.  
  
What Chelsea has achieved is quite remarkable. I don't like Chelsea or the way they play, but I must admit that their achievement is truly fabulous.  
But the amazing run is going to end on when Manchester United visit the bridge. The Red Devils have completed a remarkable recovery after their worst start to a season since Sir Alex Ferguson took over the reins at Old Trafford.  
  
But it is not just the lead that Manchester United possesses that make them the favorites to end Chelsea's remarkable run of unbeaten home matches. Manchester United have shown throughout the season why they deserve to be champions. They have played some expansive football, netting the most number of goals in the division. United's defence has been rock solid throughout the season, and the RedDevils have conceded only a paltry number of goals.  
  
United will certainly miss Nemanja Vidic, who is likely to sit out the match due to a knee injury sufferered during the Champions League semifinal against AS Roma. But United have a squad that is still very formidable even with two or three changes.  
And not to forget that boy from Madeira - Cristiano Ronaldo has proved week in week out why pundits back him to bag all the major individual football awards up for grabbing. The Portuguese winger is in fine scoring form, having overtaken 'El Beatle' George Best's record for the maximum number of goals from a winger. The charismatic youngster will be keen to prove a point to people who still doubts his ability to perform in the big games.  
  
Now on to Chelsea and the fact that even Paul Jewell did not find himself the target of hate chants from the terraces highlight the sorry state Chelsea is in. Avram Grant is not tactically brilliant and yet under him Chelsea reached the Carling Cup final, overtook arsenal at the second position and yet the Chelsea faithful are reluctant to support him. The Israeli is criticised for his defensive minded substitutions in the Carling Cup final.  
  
Against Wigan it was painful to watch Shevchenko, sitting on the bench, nonchalant, with no apparent interest in the game, wondering when the agents from Milan will arrive in London. Shevchenko is a legend of the European game, with his formidable scoring tally for Milan in Serie A and more importantly in the Champions League. And yet he struggles to make the bench.  
And I cannot still understand why Avram Grant brought Sheva on in the 93rd minute, after Emile Hesky had equalized for the Lactics. Sheva did not even get a touch of the ball. Was it a conscious ploy by Grant to intimidate Sheva or is it a cheap trick to gain leverage in discussions about Sheva's imminent move back to Milan?  
  
If anybody wants to beat Chelsea at the bridge , this is the time to do it. I am sure Sir Alex would love to win the title at the Bridge and he has all the resources in his disposal to do it. So Chelsea's long standing run of home wins is going to end soon.
