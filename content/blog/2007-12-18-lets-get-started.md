I have been pondering on writing a blog for so long and I was confused on what to write .  
  
At last I have decided what I want to write about- the topic that I know most about and nobody else knows much about- yes, I have decided to write about me and the world as I look at it .  
I cannot assure you that my blog will win your heart or it will be pleasing to read but I can assure you one thing- every single word that would be written will come straight from my heart.
  
Keep checking out my blog - there is more,hopefully interesting posts to come.
