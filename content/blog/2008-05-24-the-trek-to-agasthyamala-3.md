After the forest guards were convinced we didn't carry anything illegal and we were introduced to our guide, we set out on to the trail. I was already at the front of the pack and soon my friend Manu joined me. Ans so, we began to set the pace for the group. Most of the pictures were taken by my friends in the group, and they were very slow to say they least, because they were shooting pictures on every corner of the trail. And luckily for me, the guide chose to stick with them.  
  
Walking through the trail, all alone with just the sun, the skies, the trees and mother earth around us, Manu and I were really enjoying it.  
  
At first the trail was taking us through a plane, but after about 30 minutes we began to notice that we were beginning to climb, but through very low slopes. We saw streams and from one we thought had real flowing water, we refilled the water bottles with fresh real mountain water. Manu felt it would be fit to be bottled and served in the best restaurants of the world, and I can vouch for that, because it was so pure and sweet.
