Yesterday was my first day in the training program at ThoughtWorks. It was lots of fun. The best part of it was learning about the values TW stands for. That, along with reading about Roy's vision has given me a feeling of pride that I am working for a company that is part of a larger movement. Now I have to acquire the skills that would make me useful at ThoughtWorks.

The real technical sessions start today. I am really looking forward to it.

The sense of being awed by this big City is finally receding. During the weekend, I paid a visit to one of my friends in another part of Bangalore, and I could easily see that there was real life in Bangalore - life of struggle and toil. So that has kind of made me feel at home. Apart from that, I had a great session with my coach, and I think finally I feel comfortable in the City.  

I happened to chat with a fellow trainee about life in the City and all the frills that comes with it. I could really identify with his dislike for the 'false aristocracy' that we see around. I think I will find more people thinking on the same lines.
