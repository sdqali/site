The Barclays Premier League is halfway through, and it has been one hell of a ride. Upsets, declines of perennial strong teams, rise of the challengers and amazing newcomers, EPL had it all.  
   
In this piece, I am attempting to write down some stuff that truly symbolizes the half-season gone by.  
  
**The surprise package - Hull City FC**  
A lot has been said and written about the Yorkshire club who made their first ever appearance in the English top division. With gutsy displays and a game style that seems to have been borrowed from Bolton Wanderers, Hull were inside the Champions League positions for six weeks. Although they had to climb down th table owing to a drop in form, Phil Brown's team deserve the title of the leagues surprise package. The victory against Arsenal at the Emirates stadium is their season's highlight so far.

**The best signing - Steed Malbranque**  
The French midielder was not exactly in the scheme of things at White Hart Lane under Juande Ramos, and accepted an offer from the not-so-fashionable Sunderland. He instantly became a hero at the Stadium of Light. With his hardworking nature and creativity, he has won over the Black Cat hearts .

**New faces - Rafael Silva and Jose Bosingwa**   
Two right backs who do more attacking than defending. Rafael Silva is seen as the permanent replacement for the aging Gary Neville at Old Trafford, and within a year in Manchester, has already posed a threat to the veteran's place in Sir Alex's starting line up. Attack minded, with great ball control and crossing ability, Rafael also possesses a mean tackle. the goal he scored in United's 2-1 defeat to the Gunners at the Emirates is testimony to his shooting ability.  
Jose Bosingwa is one of the prime components of Chelsea's attacking moves this season.He is quick, has got some tricks up his sleeve, and invariably produces a telling cross from the flanks.

**Most memorable moment- Grant Leadbitter against Arsenal**  
There are many moments worth mentioning, but this one wins the race purely due to the strength of emotion the moment carried. At the Stadium of Light, on 4th october, 2008 with the match against Arsenal in a stalemate at 0-0, Roy Keane brings on local boy, Sunderland youth academy product and England U-21 international Grant Leadbitter in the 87th minute. The youngster scores in the 89th minute with a sumptuous volley. Then he races towards the touchline, tears rolling down his cheeks, and kneels at the piece of earth betweens the touchline and the tunnel and kisses the ground. It surely is one of the strongest football images I have witnessed in my life.
