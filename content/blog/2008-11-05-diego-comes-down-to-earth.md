Okay, I admit you have heard those words before, but I could not think of any other title as I sat to write about Diego Maradona's unveiling as the Coach of Argentina's football team!

Diego has been appointed as Argentina's coach, and his first assignment will be a friendly against Scotland at Hampden Park on 19th November and he has announced the [squad for the match](http://argentina.worldcupblog.org/2010-world-cup-qualifying/diego-names-his-squad-for-scotland-friendly.html).  

Diego is like a God in Argentina, there is even a church called the Church of Maradona, where Christmas is celebrated on Diego's birthday. He is the best player in the game's rich history, challenged to that position only by Pele. He has won it all, including the World Cup. And now, he is risking the loss of the title of God by taking up the post of the national coach.

The coach in Diego has been , well let me put it this way, average. He has so far managed only two teams- Mandiyú de Corrientes and Racing Club de Avellaneda. He was on the touchline for a total of 23 games, and his team(s) won only three of the matches.

That is hardly the kind of form the Argentina national side are looking for these days. They are in a very bad situation, having won just four of their 10 qualifying matches for the 2010 FIFA World Cup. Maradona's predecessor Alfio Bassel was sacked after his team's 1-0 loss to Chile. Argentina is currently third in [the South American table](http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/preliminaries/southamerica/standings/index.html), behind Paraguay and Brazil. Chile is breathing down their neck, level on points, but behind on goal difference.

If Diego fails to reverse the fortunes of his beloved team very quickly, he may possibly lose the God status. Once the world sees that Diego is just a mortal, prone to mistakes and fallible in judgment, like any of the other managers, people will will certainly have doubts regarding the God-ness of Diego.

Wait, we are talking about Mardona, righ ? He can certainly inspire people and he absolutely loves Argentine football, and certainly posesses the footballing brain. His players need to transform his charisma , inspiration and intellect into solid displays on the field. The Messi's , Tevez's and the Aguerro's and their performances will bolster or destroy Diego's God-ness in the days to come.
