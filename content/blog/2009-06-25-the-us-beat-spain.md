I missed one of the greatest upsets in recent footbal history, because of the failed cable network.

The United States beat mighty Spain in the first semi final of the Confederations Cup. Spain was unbeaten for 35 matches prior to this and to think the US beat them.

The fact that I missed it adds to compound my post-college woes.
