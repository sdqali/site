Well, I have been trying to change for sometime now. And change is not coming way, or I should rather say I am not going towards change, at the rate I want to.  

I want to stop getting involved in silly arguments, and more than anything, I just want to be looked upon by the rest as one of them. Unfortunately for me, certain deeds I have done in my past is not helping my cause - past fight and arguments on the football field.
  
I thought I would get a clean slate, when I wanted to change. But now I realize, clean slates are hard to come by. You get one only once in your life.It is not up to me to wish I had a clean slate. I have a dirty slate, because I made it dirty. The only way out, is for me to make it clean and then possibly fill it with good stuff.
