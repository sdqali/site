Ever since I wrote the third part of my article about the trek to Agasthyamala, I was caught up in a stream of pretty exhausting activities.  
But since passing examinations and securing a job offer are things that fall in to the category of must-do's, activities like watching football, blogging, orkutting etc. have had to climb down the ladder of priorities in life. It was the off-season as far as football was concerned and staying away from watching football was not that tough (There was of course Euro 2008, but then, England had managed to not qualify ).  
  
So after securing a job offer (at ThoughtWorks) and having written my exams, I am back to blogging. It is almost the start of the new football season in Europe, so there wont be scarcity of topics to write about.
