> I'm forever blowing bubbles,  
>  Pretty bubbles in the air.  
>  They fly so high,  
>  Nearly reach the sky,  
>  Then like my dreams,  
>  They fade and die.  
>  Fortune's always hiding,  
>  I've looked everywhere,  
>  I'm forever blowing bubbles,  
>  Pretty bubbles in the air

  
I am no West Ham United fan, but happened to listen to [their anthem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%27m_Forever_Blowing_Bubbles) again. It is marvelous piece of poetry, although poetry is the last word you would use to describe West Ham's football.  

I first listened this song when I watched the movie "Green Street Hooligans", a film on West Ham United's supporter firm called "The Green Street Elite". I instantly developed a liking for the song. When you listen to it, you can really feel why the Hammer's can connect themselves with the song. They have not managed to win something meaningful for long.  

What really got me into listening this song again was my team's recent defeat in the football tournament at my hostel. We lost in the semifinals in the penalty shootout. It was just agonizing. While I sat in my room alone,lights switched off, fresh sweat dripping from my body, I overheard somebody in the corridor saying "We have no luck!". Well, that is true. It brought back memories of listening to the bubbles song, as it was originally called, before it become synonymous with West Ham United. I got the song from the internet after much searching, and I sat in my room again, listening to the song. It didn't help me to forget the gloom, but it helped to put things in perspective.
