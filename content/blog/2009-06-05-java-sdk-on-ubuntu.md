I love Java, and I think I will be doing a lot of stuff in Java once I start out at ThoughtWorks. They have given me some books to learn Java and Extreme Programming. Since I have six weeks between leaving college and joining ThoughtWorks, I had decided that I would do the studying once I am done with college.  

One of my prime concerns when I switched to Ubuntu was how I will manage to do Java, as there is nothing like writing line of code to learn coding. So I spent most of the morning downloading and installing the Java 6 SDK from Sun. It took a lot of time (127 megabytes) if I remember right and it was a real pain waiting for the download to complete. Many of the people with whom I share the internet connection at the hostel had decided to download stuff at exactly the same time. But when the download finished, the installation took very little time.  

And finally I sat about checking if I had got everything right. All the code I had written about 18 months ago, when I was really in to learning Java worked. I was pleasantly surprised to see the LAN chat application I wrote in my projects folder. And it worked.  

It brought back lots of memories, of night-outs spent learning Java, broken only by the tea from the hostel snacks-bar at around midnight. And of the sheer struggle to get your hands on as much _Porottas_ and pieces of mutton as you possibly could from the take-away bag from _Buhari_. For those who don't know _Buhari_, it is a small restaurant in Trivandrum that is open almost around the clock and belts out a great combination of very tasty mutton curry and _Puttu_. We preferred _Porottas_ to _Puttu_.
  
I am beginning to look forward to the six week holidays, when I can spend some quality time at home and hopefully learn lots of Java. I have doubts about the latter, but one thing is sure, when I take my computer home this month, it wont have Windows.
