After the breakfast, it was time to start the real journey. We collected our bags and set out for the Forest Departments check post. The scenery of the Estate was so breath taking. Although it is a Tea estate, it has been almost a decade since any tea-making really took place here. It was shut down because of constant struggle between Tata Tea and the Trade Unions. Most of the employees made makeshift homes and settled down in the estate. The situation is really illustrated by the state of the tea-processing factory.  

We reached the check post and a huge board welcomed us , that said we could not carry any alcoholic substances, drugs or cigarettes , and that we were to strictly follow the guide. I decided then and there that I was going to violate the last instruction. I wanted to walk through the trail, freely with nobody in my vicinity, just me , the skies and the greenery.

The forest and the trail lay before us, and once the forest guards had gone through all our belongings and were sure we carried no illegals stuff and had introduced us to our guide, we stepped on to the trail.
