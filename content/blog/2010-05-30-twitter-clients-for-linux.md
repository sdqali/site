Today, I installed Yasst. If I remember correctly, I have tried no less than 8 twitter clients. The list includes Gwibber, Choqok, Pino, Turpial and Yasst. I liked certain features in some of these clients and absolutely hated others. I have not managed to find many that I really like. I like twittering-mode a lot, although it is more of a twitter clients for Emacs, than a client for linux. This is my review of the main Linux twitter clients I have tried.  
  
Gwibber  
[Gwibber](http://gwibber.com/) has become Ubuntu's default twitter client with the launch of Ubuntu 10.04 LTS. It integrates with Ubuntu's gnome menu. It lets you access Flickr, Twitter, and Facebook accounts and provides multi-tab views.  
  
What I liked: It integrates seamlessly with Ubuntu's interface.  
What I didn't like: At times, when I start Gwibber, the tweets take forever to load, and there has been cases where no tweets appeared in the main and mentioned timelines, even after five minutes.  
  
Choqok  
[Choqok](http://choqok.gnufolks.org/) is a project started by Mehrdad Momeny. It uses Qt libraries, and hence is a 'KDE Micro-Blogging Client' as the authors themselves claim. It has support for twitter and identi.ca. It has tabbed views and is very stable.  
  
What I liked: I really liked the interface, and the over all experience of using Choqok.  
What I didn't like: Choqok is written in Qt. I run Gnome (mostly) and XFCE (sometimes). Do I want to pull in 100 MBs of Qt libraries just because I want to use a twitter clients? No.  
  
Pino  
[Pino](http://pino-app.appspot.com/) is a great light weight client written in the Vala language, which is gaining popularity among Gnome fans. Poino does not have a multi-tab view.  
  
What I liked: The interface is good.  
What I didn't like: There is no multi-tab view. The app is so unstable, it reminded me of my days as Windows user.  
  
Turpial  
[Turpial](http://turpial.org.ve/) is a twitter client from Venezuela, and is written in Python. It has a great interface, and integrates with the system tray in Gnome. It has multi-tab views. It has a 'wide mode' that lets you view different timelines side-by-side. Even the sound that it uses to notify you when there is a new tweet is a class apart. Turpiial's stable version supports only Spanish, but the latest betas have support for English and other major languages.  
  
What I like: The wide-mode and the notification sound.  
What I don't like: The default font size is a bit too small for my comfort and there is no option to change the font or font size.  
  
Yasst  
[Yasst](http://www.yasst.org/index.php) is a cross-platform twitter client written by Ian Clark in Qt. It has tabbed views, and the wide view similar to Tweetdeck. I am presently trying it out.   
  
What I like: The wide view.  
What I don't like: It does not appear on the system tray in my Ubuntu 10.04 Ggnome, although the Changes page in the website says they have a System tray icon.  
  
  
Conclusion  
I am presently using twittering-mode in Emacs and Turpialas my twitter clients. I like Turpial and would be using it for all tweeting if there was a way to customize font sizes.
