It is yet another football tournament at the hostel. It means a lot of things to me. The most important thing is I madly love football. Secondly this is that time of the year when I tend to make lot of enemies, by reacting to trash-talk.  
  
My team has been perennial under achievers as far as football is concerned at the hostel. We play well but have never won anything. The journey usually ends with disappointing defeats in the semi-final and final.
  
The first time I played in the tournament, we were too afraid of the seniors to play real football and conceded bucket full of goals. I don't remember the exact score, but looking back, I feel it might have been 10-0.  
  
The next tournament we played was a real turning point for us on the field and off it. We played some amazing football and reached the quarter-finals where we were to play our seniors, who were the defending champions. On a day when each member of my team gave all they got, we scored two beautiful goals and were leading the match 2-1 when the regulation time ended. But the referee was in no mood to blow the whistle. Ten minutes later, the referee did blow the whistle, seconds after the seniors had scored. And the realization drowned to us - freshers were "not supposed to win" football matches.
We played a re-match the day after, but the seniors easily beat a demoralized side 3-0.  
  
The tournament is here again and this time we are in the semis, pitted against our juniors, who I must admit are a formidable opposition.  
But I desperately want to win it. I hope I do.
