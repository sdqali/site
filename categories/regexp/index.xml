      <description>Ruby&amp;rsquo;s regular expressions support named capture groups, since 1.9. However, there is a weird behaviour while using named capture groups with the Regexp#=~ method. When named capture groups are used with =~, the captured values are placed in local variables with the same name as the capture group. The following example demonstrates this:&#xA;#!/usr/bin/env ruby month = &amp;#34;January&amp;#34; test_string = &amp;#34;Today&amp;#39;s date is: 9/28/2013.&amp;#34; /(?&amp;lt;month&amp;gt;\d{1,2})\/(?&amp;lt;day&amp;gt;\d{1,2})\/(?&amp;lt;year&amp;gt;\d{4})/ =~ test_string puts month.inspect This when executed will print 9.</description>

      <description>I will admit that I find regular expressions somewhat hard to parse. While the thinking process needed to write a regular expression is iterative and hence results in the correct expression suitable for the situation, once it is written it lacks readability. I have faced that pain of trying to grok a complex regular expression written years ago. So I was pleasantly surprised when I saw this example from Hacker News user WestCoastJustin.</description>
