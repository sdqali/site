      <title>Navigating Stacktraces in Emacs</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had to debug an issue today and that meant dealing with Rails stack traces. I got tired of having to constantly switch between reading the trace in the terminal and the code in Emacs to figure out what was going wrong and get more context around it. I felt that there should be an easier way of doing this. A quick search &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; did not yield anything. But then I remembered Grep mode &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and it occurred to me that hijacking Grep mode&amp;rsquo;s navigation feature would let me navigate the stack trace better. This is the solution I came up with.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Emacs hack: Viewing Git logs while composing commit messages</title>

      <description>I use Emacs as my editor to compose Git commit messages. I almost never commit from the terminal with git commit -m. This approach has two advantages: I get a chance to verify what is being committed and get to compose the message using a proper editor complete with spell checking provided by flyspell mode. One thing I wish I had access to while composing commit messages is the git log.</description>

      <description>TL;DR - Use the core.commentchar configuration to change the character Git uses to mark comment lines in commit messages.&#xA;My team has a convention of putting the number of the current Issue/Ticket/Story that we are working on at the beginning of every commit message. This is great because it lets us make sense of the history of our code by helping us answer&#xA;What were the changes made to the code base to build a feature or fix an issue?</description>

      <title>Reducing Emacs startup time while committing</title>

      <description>I use Emacs as my primary text editor and I use it to edit commit messages for Git. I almost never use the -m option with git commit. Since I have a fairly customised Emacs configuration based around Sam Aaron&amp;rsquo;s Emacs Live, this means that for every commit, there is a visible delay for Emacs to start up for the commit message. I was looking for ways to reduce this and figured out that running Emacs in daemon mode and using emacsclient as the GIT_EDITOR would solve this.</description>

      <title>Fixing Flyspell for Emacs in Mac OS X</title>

      <description>I use the flyspell-mode as a spell checking mechanism in emacs. Recently, I moved to Mac OS X, and I began to get this error whenever I started emacs:&#xA;Error enabling Flyspell mode: (Searching for program No such file or directory aspell) I had installed aspell with Homebrew. The issue seemed to be that Emacs was unable to find the aspell binary. Homebrew installs binaries in /usr/local/bin and it was in my $PATH.</description>
