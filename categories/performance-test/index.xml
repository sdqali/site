      <description>&lt;meta content=&#34;jmeter, login&#34; name=&#34;keywords&#34;&gt;&#xA;I had to set up a JMeter test last week - the test included logging in to a site, and then hitting a bunch of URLs, all of them being GET requests. I found it hard to find a simple documentation that described how to do this - the ones I found were either incomplete or were trying to teach me a large number of things at the same time. So when I figured it out, I decided to write this down, for anyone else finding themselves in the same place as me.&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For this example, the application under test is a simple Rails application, with the login form at &lt;code&gt;/login&lt;/code&gt; and a &lt;code&gt;POST&lt;/code&gt; request to &lt;code&gt;/login&lt;/code&gt; does the authentication.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
