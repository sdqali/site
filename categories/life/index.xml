      <title>A rainy distraction</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Far away, the Sutro TV tower was hardly visible in the haze of rain.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;So, this is what you were talking about in the morning? I thought it was the other calculation. You are right!&amp;rdquo;. You suddenly feel happy and detect the smugness creeping to your face. I was right, I told you so, you want to say. But you don&amp;rsquo;t. &amp;ldquo;Not today! The smugness will have to die.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As the thick rain drops fall on your naked torso, causing that ever so little note of pain that you have come to like and seek, you roll the muddy football under your feet and look up. Hands go up on the right flank and the young lad hugging his touch line is impatient and the wave of his hands are frantic. You turn your head and survey the left flank. Nothing going there, you quickly realise.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>On Halal Burgers</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What would you like to have today?&amp;rdquo; The lady at the counter cheerfully asks. I smile back at her, take another cursory glance at the menu and with a sigh say &amp;ldquo;I will take the Teriyaki Salmon Sandwich, please!&amp;rdquo;. I take another look at all the menu and can&amp;rsquo;t help notice how sad I am. The assortment of meat preparations bundled between two pieces of bread that could have been mine is long and diverse. I suck my teeth and promise myself that I will be paying the butcher a visit in the evening.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Biriyani and me</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I love Biriyani. That is an understatement. I absolutely love Biriyani.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It started when I was very young. In fact, as far back as I can remember, I have loved Biriyani. A lot of people in my family - my father, a paternal uncle and his wife were cooks, and specialists in cooking for special occasions. In Malabar, that meant people employed them to cook at weddings, engagements, &lt;em&gt;Iftars&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Parasavathinu Kontu Pokals&lt;/em&gt; &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Mudikalachils&lt;/em&gt; &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. They would cook up a storm of Biryani, &lt;em&gt;Neychor&lt;/em&gt; &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Porotta&lt;/em&gt; &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Pathiri&lt;/em&gt; &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and curries of beef, chicken and mutton. Of all these things, the Biriyanis were the best.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Fireworks in the paddy fields - memories of a summer</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Like most people, I like certain songs for their ability to bring back memories of times, places and people from the past that you don&amp;rsquo;t everyday bring out from the cellars of time, wipe away the cobwebs and dust and gaze at. &lt;em&gt;Kannu Nattu Kaathirunnittum&lt;/em&gt; &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; from the movie &lt;em&gt;Kathaavasheshan&lt;/em&gt; &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; evokes memories of childhood, the daily struggle to survive and the inability to resist the hegemony of those around you who call the shots. But, there are not many songs that does it for me quite like the Malayalam song &lt;em&gt;Alliyaambal Kadavil&lt;/em&gt; &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>First week in San Francisco</title>
      <link>https://sadique.io/blog/2013/01/21/first-week-in-san-francisco/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I moved to San Francisco last week and is just getting acquainted with&#xA;the city. This blog&#xA;post is a summary of my first impressions of SF to share with a lot of friends whom I have not been able to keep in touch and who have been wondering what I am up to.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;it-is-cold-here&#34;&gt;It is cold here&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I landed in SF without enough winter wear. I had a windbreaker that I&#xA;used in Bangalore and provided more than adequate warmth back in&#xA;Bangalore. Soon, I realised that it won&amp;rsquo;t be enough. Temperatures were&#xA;under 10 C. I had to get a proper jacket.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Giving up the Samba for the Tiki-taka</title>
      <link>https://sadique.io/blog/2012/08/21/giving-up-the-samba-for-the-tiki-taka/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A shot flew over the bar. The goal keeper showed great urgency in&#xA;collecting the ball from behind the goal. Instead of kicking it forward, he pushed the ball&#xA;gently out to the centre back. As the opposition forward streamed&#xA;forward to close him down, the defender moved the ball swiftly and pushed it to&#xA;the right back who was level with the penalty box. Another push and the&#xA;central mid fielder was brought in to the play. A through ball to the&#xA;left found the player on the left wing and as the opposing&#xA;right back zoomed in to focus, he played it back to his left back. As&#xA;the left back controlled the ball, his&#xA;team repositioned themselves to start from scratch all over again. To build&#xA;from the back.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you have watched football in the recent past, you would recognise a&#xA;pattern here. You would see the unmistakable Barcelona blueprint. Except&#xA;that I am not describing Barcelona. Not even Spain. In fact when the&#xA;initial shot flew over the bar, there was no collective sigh of relief&#xA;from a crowd &lt;a href=&#34;%22http://mkbarcelona.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/200311-005.jpg%22&#34;&gt;packed till the heavens&lt;/a&gt;,&#xA;there was no eager ball boy to throw the ball back at the keeper and&#xA;there was no one in the dug out shouting instructions at the&#xA;players. Hell, there was not even a dug out near the touch line. The&#xA;keeper ran to the construction site where the ball had found it&amp;rsquo;s way&#xA;through and ran back all the way to get the play restarted. As he was&#xA;still was running back, the left back of my opponents walked back to his&#xA;position, his face embellished with a smile bore out of his pride&#xA;of having bent his shot around the cashew tree inside the&#xA;ground.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As I picked up my bicycle, climbed on it and spotted the blood on my elbows and the bunch of curious onlookers in front of the pan shop nearby, I did not feel fear or embarrassment. I had an immeasurable amount of happiness welling inside me. I had finally done what I should have about 20 years ago - I had finally managed to crash my bicycle and leave with plenty of scars to show for it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am 25, and until two weeks ago I could not ride a bicycle. Two weeks ago, during a Saturday afternoon, I got on a bicycle and rode it around a football field. Well, what is so special about that, you might ask. It was pretty special to me because it was the first time I had rode a bicycle, where my definition of &amp;lsquo;ride&amp;rsquo; is &amp;lsquo;ride with a level of confidence that removes the fear on falling down!&amp;rsquo;. When it finally happened, it was like what Kevin Garnett &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_gL_H9zAY8&#34;&gt;described&lt;/a&gt; when he finally won an NBA with the Celtics after years of disappointment with the Minnesota Timberwolves - &amp;ldquo;I Just Knocked the Bully Out&amp;rdquo;. Yes, I was emotional. No, I did not cry. But it had been a long time coming, and the journey was painful. Here is the story of me learning to cycle.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Njaan Varaam, Assalamu Alaikum&lt;/em&gt; (I will be back, Peace Be Upon You). I felt myself choking as those words escaped my mouth. And as I reached the gate and took my first step out, I heard my mother say &lt;em&gt;Wa Alaikum Assalaam&lt;/em&gt; (Peace Be Upon You, too). And then I felt the straps of the laptop bag sink into my shoulders, and it felt so heavy. It should not be. It still had the same stuff as it did when I set on my journey home on the Friday evening. In fact, it should feel lighter, as I had moved some stuff into another bag, which I was holding in my right hand. Sigh! I knew why I choked and the bag felt heavier.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Missing the game</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have continued to watch and follow the beautiful game, save for my first few months in Bangalore. This is supposed to be a metro. Well, apparently a metro where people don&amp;rsquo;t give a damn about football. After taking a cable connection, I soon realized that I will have to beg with the cable guy to put on ESPNStar so that I could watch EPL. Pretty soon, Hathway had some issues with ESPNStar, which meant there was no way I could watch ESPNStar. On the weekends, I tried to pursue the cable operator to put on NEO Sports, at least I could watch Bundes Liga and Serie A. He would not budge, and I had to endure the interesting argument that &amp;ldquo;NEO Cricket and NEO Sports are the same&amp;rdquo;. It was tough to accept - in the small village of Vadakkethala, where I hail from, I could watch as much football as I wanted. In Malappuram, if you are a cable TV operator and don&amp;rsquo;t put on channels with football on, God save you. So Bangalore&amp;rsquo;s apparent indifference to football was frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As I had predicted, the last week of training was hectic, chaotic and crazy. Although we ended up leaving the whole project simulation in jeopardy, we learned a lot of things, especially how things that work smoothly at one second can go wrong very very wrong the next second.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I had decided beforehand that I would volunteer for roles that I want to do in my career, and that at the same time would leave me out of my comfort zone. I played the BA role for two days, and although I made lots of mistakes, I did certain things well. I was appreciated for the e-mails I sent out that day. And I got some nice feedback from the head of training, and I am sure his words will help me in my way forward.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The past few days have just flown by. I had to learn so much things and did not have much time to do it. Most days, I sleep around 2:00 in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When I was in college, I had friends who were already working. I used to wonder why sometimes they did not reply to a mail I sent, or did not ping me back when I pinged them on IM. Well, now I know! If any of you are reading this, please pardon me for not understanding.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yet another week of my Bangalore life has unfolded. It was tougher, and better than the first two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I learned lots of new stuff, stuff that would greatly help me in my profession. I made friends with new people. But most important of all, I got some feedback on some of the things I do in life. It was kind of very scary, to be honest. But then I realized that the feedback will let me improve. I am trying hard to use the feedback in the most positive way possible.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is my 13th day in Bangalore. And the first week of my training at ToughtWorks has gone by. I learned lots of stuff, talked to some great people and made friends with some of them. I still have not overcome the difficulties of adapting to life in the City. May be I will soon, or I never will.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I had planned to post everyday about my experiences in TWU. But I did not have much time. The sessions last till 5:00 pm, and then I will be very tired to do much. I am really missing football. I had hoped to play with my friend Aneesh on last Sunday, but we were not allowed to play as one old guy who turned up decided that only regulars could play there.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I happened to watch the show &amp;lsquo;The Buck Stops Here&amp;rsquo; presented by Barkha Dutt on NDTV 24 X 7.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The trial of Ajmal Qasab, the lone terrorist captured during the Nov.27 attack on Mumbai and fellow defendants had begun in Mumbai and the court relieved Anjali Waghmare, the lawyer appointed by the court to defend Qasab, because of what it saw as a conflict of interest. Anjali Waghmare is the wife of a policeman. Qasab asked for a Pakistani lawyer to represent him.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>When I used to love Cricket</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Taking a tour through the orkut albums of some of my friends from my school, I happened to see a photo of us in the playground, shot after a game of cricket. And there I was - thin, short and most surprisingly for me, with a cricket bat in my hand. True, I have seen the photo a number of times, I had even commented on it, but today, the bat in my hand reminding me solidly that I once used to play cricket and love it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Of Birthdays and Anniversaries</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week, we celebrated the birthday of one of my friends. There was not much of celebration per se, we just went to his place, talked a lot and had food from a restaurant. The restaurant bill was paid by the three guests, and not the host, but that is another story.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It had been a long since the four of us had come together, and so we talked about all stuff. My friend,the birthday boy, a student of nursing was apparently neck-deep in politics and was planning an agitation against the State governments decision to scrap Entrance Exams for some of the medical courses. Like every time we had a conversation back in school, our discussions turned a bit philosophical and soon we were arguing about the relevance of birthdays, anniversaries and New Years.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
